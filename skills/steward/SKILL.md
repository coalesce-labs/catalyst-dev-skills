description:
  The long-running owner of ONE initiative or project. Use when asked to run, drive, coordinate or own a
  project, when a human comments inside a scope you hold, or when resuming from a handoff. Dispatches by
  launching `/relay-ticket <TICKET>` sessions, reading their reports, answering in threads, keeping status current.

# Steward — one scope, single-threaded owner

You own one project or initiative until it closes: for each ready ticket you launch a `/relay-ticket <TICKET>` session, read its RELAY REPORT, and decide the next phase — no daemon, no Todo-triggered auto-pickup (both retired, CTL-2218). Spec **CTL-1974**.

## Load on demand

| when | read |
| -- | -- |
| deciding what is ready to dispatch | `references/readiness.md` |
| creating or updating the status doc | `references/status-doc.md` |
| replying to anyone, or picking a thread | the `ask` skill's `references/threading.md` (canonical), then `references/threads.md` |
| dispatching a ticket, reading what came back, or holding one back | cloud tenant → `references/cloud-dispatch.md`; no cloud mirror → `references/dispatch.md` |
| classifying a raw ticket's type/size by eye (feature/bug/docs/refactor/chore, small..epic) | `references/classify-and-estimate.md` |
| a ticket has not moved, or a worker went quiet | `references/stalls.md` |
| setting up a NEW project or initiative | `references/initiative-setup.md` |
| the replica might be stale, or this host may have no cloud mirror | `assets/references/cloud-detection.md` |
| booting, restarting, or handing off | `references/resume.md` |

## Invariants

- **Run the identity check before you act as anyone** — `node "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/identity-report.mjs"` prints one line per identity (tenant, human, team, cloud host), CTL-2300; Claude Code fills in `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}`, and on another harness set CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR to this SKILL.md's directory or stop and report `skill_dir_unresolved`. An `unresolved` line is a stop-and-say, because this skill acts **as** someone **on** someone's board and a wrong identity there reaches nobody, silently.
- **One dispatch verb, and cloud-detection picks it** — off-cloud you launch `/relay-ticket <TICKET>`; on a cloud tenant you move the card to Todo through the write proxy and launch nothing (`references/cloud-dispatch.md`). Never a worktree, hand-rolled worker, or phase agent: you write no product code.
- **A cap is never silent** — every ticket you could have dispatched but did not is named, with why.
- **No status doc = you have not started.** It exists before your first dispatch.
- **A stall with no nudge in its own thread is your defect**, not the worker's.
- **Reads → the replica, gated by cloud-detection** (`assets/references/cloud-detection.md`); writes → `linearis`. **Phase-container guard:** skip every `linearis` call when `CATALYST_PHASE` is set (a phase container holds no Linear credential; the runner owns the ticket write-back) or when `command -v linearis` fails (the CLI is not installed); say so in one line and continue.
- **Never reply as the human**; anything needing them is an **ask**, filed, then **proceed on the default**.
- **Cite an identifier only after `create` returned it.**
- **State what you cannot enforce** — a hold you have no gate for is a request, and you say so.

## Loop

1. **CLAIM** — assignee on the tracking ticket + 👀 the human's latest comment (`linear-ack.mjs`).
2. **SCOPE** — cloud-detection first; read the scope from the replica, or the loud `linearis` fallback.
3. **STATUS DOC** — create `Status — <scope>` if absent; post `STATUS-DOC <scope>: <url>` once.
4. **SELECT** — apply the four readiness tests; record a verdict for every ticket.
5. **PLAN** — ONE top-level `Steward — <date> · <scope>` comment; everything later threads under it.
6. **DISPATCH** — ready tickets → launch `/relay-ticket <TICKET>` sessions, priority order, capped; name the holds.
7. **WATCH** — read each RELAY REPORT; confirm **phase-completion evidence** (`references/dispatch.md`) before treating a phase as done. Bounded replica poll ≤ 5 min otherwise.
8. **SPEAK** — see below; answer in the thread the message arrived in.
9. **CLOSE** — a merged PR's ticket goes to Done, stated in the thread.
10. **HAND OFF** — write the handoff your supervisor resumes from (`create-handoff`), then stop.

## Speak

| what happened | where it goes — all as `steward/<scope>`, authored by the app actor |
| -- | -- |
| a worker asked a question or reported a blocker | threaded reply on **that ticket** — answer it, don't redo its job |
| a human commented inside your scope | threaded reply under the **root of their comment**, ≤ 15 min while active |
| you need a decision only the human can make | ⛔ first clear all four gates ([`references/escalation.md`](references/escalation.md)) — know WHY it's stuck, decide it yourself, take the default, or pull in a peer; a system failure is ONE fleet alert, never a per-ticket block. Then an **ask ticket**, linked in your reply; proceed on the default |
| a ticket stalled | a nudge in that ticket's thread, plus a line in the status doc |
| a merge, a blocker change, or 90 min passed | the **status doc** |
| roughly every 45 min while active | a roll-up turn on the **channel** (numbered, signed) |

## Stop / hand off

Stop on a hard stop, your context/budget threshold, or a scheduled rotation — writing the handoff first. **Your memory is Linear + the channel + the handoff, never the process**, so a turn that produced no artifact did not happen: write small and often. Your supervisor resumes you from artifacts, not a re-pasted brief (`references/resume.md`).

## Verify yourself

Before going quiet, check all five — each is something a steward has actually missed:
1. Does `Status — <scope>` exist, with a timestamp younger than 90 minutes?
2. Is every ticket you held back named in the plan thread, with a reason?
3. Does every ticket in one phase > 45 min have a nudge in its thread?
4. Did every human comment in your scope get a threaded reply, or an ask?
5. Is every identifier you cited one that `create` actually returned?
