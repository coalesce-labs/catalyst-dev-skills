# Stalls — noticing, nudging, escalating

## What a stall is

A ticket that has been in **one phase for more than 45 minutes** with no new comment, no state change and no push. That is the default threshold; the long phases are the exceptions, not the rule:

| phase | expect | stalled at |
| -- | -- | -- |
| triage, plan, research, review | minutes | 45 min |
| implement | tens of minutes | 60 min |
| pr, verify, remediate | minutes | 45 min |
| monitor-merge, monitor-deploy | as long as CI/deploy takes — these **legitimately** sit | 90 min with no CI event |
| teardown | minutes | 30 min |

⚠️ **A monitor phase sitting quietly is usually correct** — it is waiting on GitHub. Before calling it a stall, check whether the thing it waits for has happened. A wedged CI job and a slow one look identical in the PR view; the discriminator is that workflow's own recent durations, not your patience.

## ⛔ A stall with no nudge in its thread is your defect

This is the failure that motivated the rule. On 2026-08-18 two dispatched tickets sat in Triage from 11:24 to 12:47 — 83 minutes. The coordinator was explicitly asked for an in-thread nudge. **No nudge was ever posted.** Both tickets eventually moved on their own, which is the worst possible outcome: it makes the gap invisible and teaches everyone the nudge was unnecessary.

The nudge costs one comment. Not posting it costs the only signal anyone has that the scope is watched.

## The nudge

Threaded on **that ticket**, not in your plan thread:

> `steward/<scope>`: this has been in `<phase>` for `<N>` min with no activity. If you are blocked, say
> what on — in this thread. If you are working, one line on where you are is enough. If this ticket is
> wrong (bad ACs, retired surface, missing dependency) say so and I will fix it rather than you working
> around it.

Then add the ticket to the status doc's **In flight** row with the stall noted. A stall the human can see in one screen is a stall nobody has to ask about.

## Escalating

1. **Nudge** in-thread (above).
2. **Second miss on the same item** → escalate to the concierge on the channel, naming the ticket, the
   phase, the elapsed time and what you already tried.
3. **Needs a decision** → an ask ticket, and proceed on the default.

⛔ **Never escalate straight to the human.** The ladder is instrument → steward → concierge → human, and the human is only ever reached as an ask. A bare escalation with no ask behind it puts a row in their queue that nothing can clear.

## Retracting a false fire (do it, don't just say it)

⚠️ **CTL-2156…CTL-2162 deleted the per-ticket human-block label.** There is no label to strip: a system-level failure is ONE fleet alert that retracts itself when the condition clears, and anything genuinely needing a person is an **ask ticket**. This section used to carry a label-removal recipe (CTL-2098); the recipe is gone, but the lesson that motivated it is not, and it now applies to the ask:

**A steward comment is not a mutation.** Steward comments are posted by the app actor — the daemon's human-provenance gate rejects them — so a comment saying "this is resolved" leaves the ask OPEN and the work it `blocks` still held. You must issue the state change directly.

- **A false-fire ASK** → close it the way the `ask` SOP closes any ask: answer in-thread, then move the
  ticket to Done with `linearis`. Reads go through the freshness-gated replica helper, never a bare `linearis issues read` (see the `linearis` skill's "Reading Linear" section).
- **A false-fire SYSTEM alert** → you do not retract it by hand. The broker raises and clears it on the
  edge; if it is stuck raised, that is a broker bug worth a ticket, not a per-ticket label to clear.

Still post an in-thread comment explaining **why** it was a false fire — the comment is the audit trail; the state change is the action. Both are complementary.

## When the instrument pages you

Board-health and the stalled-PR sweep page **you** first, in-thread, tagged `instrument/<name>`. Treat the page as data, not as a verdict: verify the item is actually stalled before acting, then act, nudge, or convert it into an ask. An instrument that reached you correctly and was ignored twice will escalate over your head — that is the design, not a punishment.
