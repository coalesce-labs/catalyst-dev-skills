# Routing — who answers, and who never does

The default answer to *"who replies to this?"* is **the steward of that scope**, in-thread, tagged, within 15 minutes while the scope is active. **Not you, and never the human.**

## The table

| the comment landed on | who replies | you |
| -- | -- | -- |
| a ticket inside a scope a steward owns | that **steward** | route it; stay out of the thread |
| a steward's own plan thread | that **steward**, same root | stay out |
| a worker's ticket, mid-phase | the **steward**; the worker may add a tagged note in the same thread | stay out |
| an initiative or project with **no** steward | **you** — then scaffold one (`scaffold.md`) | reply, then hand over |
| the **board** document | **you** | reply |
| the human's `Concierge — <human>` ticket | **you** | reply |
| a human's comment that contains a **decision** | the scope's steward files it as an **ask** under their comment | surface it on the board |

⛔ **The human never answers their own note.** If a reply would be "yes, as you said" — that is still the steward's reply to post, not the human's to write. A thread where the human is the last speaker for more than 15 minutes on an active scope is an SLA miss, not a resolved thread.

## Escalation — inward only

```
instrument  →  steward of the scope  →  concierge  →  human (as an ask)
```

- ⛔ **An instrument that reaches the human directly is a defect.** Board-health, the stalled-PR sweep and
  the comment watcher page the **steward**, threaded, tagged `instrument/<name>`. They never label, and they never post into a human's queue.
- **How the steward rung resolves (CTL-2129):** the router matches a stalled item's **scope key** — its
  Linear **project id** — against each role's `manifest.scopeKeys` (`resolveSteward`). The concierge populates that array at scaffold time via `role-supervisor/install.sh --scope-keys <projectId>` (`scaffold.md`). A project with no registered steward — or a scope key nothing matches — falls through to **you**, which is the correct backstop, not a bug.
- **Two silences from the same steward on the same item** (≈ 90 min) → the instrument pages **you** on the
  channel and the doctor goes red. Your call then is **ask vs relaunch** — say which, and why, in a channel turn. Relaunching is usually right; an ask is right when the *work* is ambiguous, not the role.
- **You** reach the human only as an **ask**, with Options and a Default.
- ⛔ **PR merge-blocker state is steward work (`merge-pr`) — never diagnose it yourself from a bare `gh pr checks` read (CTL-2298).** `Mergify Merge Protections: fail` labelled "waiting on 👀 reviews" names the **`no unresolved review threads before merge`** protection: it almost always means an existing review already left threads open, which is our work to resolve (`catalyst-dev:review-comments`, then `resolveReviewThread`), not a wait for a review to arrive. Confirm before concluding "no review posted": in GraphQL filter `pullRequest.reviewThreads.nodes[]` on `isResolved == false` (there is no `reviewThreads.unresolved` field — the `review-comments` skill's `assets/references/review-thread-resolution.md` (lines 59-65) has the working query), or read the mirror's `/admin/github/pr-activity`, whose `reviewThreads.unresolved` is a computed count; a query that errors is inconclusive, not zero, and say which of the two states you found, with the count. Measured 2026-09-07: catalyst-cloud #3024 had a Codex review with one open P2 thread; the concierge read the rollup, reported "waiting for a review", and asked the human to request one.

## Backstopping the backstop

⚠️ **"The concierge posts a holding reply" cannot backstop the concierge.** A 529 wave takes stewards and concierge together — measured twice on 2026-08-18. So two mechanisms live **outside** the fleet:

- the launchd-live **sentinel** posts the tagged holding reply *"steward/<slug> is being restarted"* at the
  15-minute mark, and the supervisor restarts the role;
- the out-of-fleet **dead-man alarm** fires when there is no concierge heartbeat **and** no channel turn
  for 30 minutes; it pushes the human once and posts on the channel.

Neither is yours to run, and that is the point — you cannot be the thing that notices you are dead.

## Pushes to the human

**P1 asks any hour.** Everything else is batched into the next **07:00–22:00 CT** window. A push is for a decision; a push that resolves to "just so you know" trains the human to ignore the next one.
