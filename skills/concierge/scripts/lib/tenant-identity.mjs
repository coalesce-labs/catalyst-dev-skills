// tenant-identity.mjs — CTL-2299. WHO the human is, WHICH team their asks are filed on,
// and WHAT the status doc calls them — all read from the tenant's own config instead of
// baked into the tools.
//
// ## What this replaces
//
// Three Ryan-shaped literals sat in the machinery and the skill text, so a customer who
// installed the plugin bundle and joined their own tenant still ran a fleet-owner's
// workspace:
//
//   * `ask.mjs`'s assignee default and `replica-comment-read.mjs`'s DEFAULT_ASK_HUMAN_ID
//     were both the string `c2a8cc92-…` — one specific Linear user in one workspace;
//   * `ask/references/creating.md` hard-coded that id AND one fleet team key as a `--team`
//     argument;
//   * `steward/references/status-doc.md` templated a `Needs from <one person's name>`
//     heading, so every tenant's status doc asked its own human for the fleet owner.
//
// A default that names a person is not a default: on any other tenant it resolves to a
// user who does not exist there. The ask is then assigned to nobody, the "latest human
// comment" query filters on an author id that authored nothing, and the ONLY symptom is
// silence — the exact shape of failure AGENTS.md's positive-control rule exists to stop.
// So this module has NO person-shaped fallback at all: it resolves from config or it
// returns a NAMED failure the caller can print.
//
// ## The ladder
//
//   humanId:  env.ASK_HUMAN_ID  →  layer1 catalyst.human.linearUserId
//                               →  layer2 catalyst.human.linearUserId  →  named failure
//   team:     explicit arg      →  env.ASK_TEAM
//                               →  layer1 catalyst.linear.teamKey      →  named failure
//   name:     env.ASK_HUMAN_NAME →  layer1/layer2 catalyst.human.name  →  null
//
// Layer 1 is the committed, per-repo `.catalyst/config.json` (override:
// `CATALYST_CONFIG_FILE`); Layer 2 is the per-machine `~/.config/catalyst/config.json`
// (override: `CATALYST_LAYER2_CONFIG_FILE`). Both path resolvers are deliberate
// near-verbatim mirrors of lib/deployment-mode.mjs and lib/entitlement.mjs — the same two
// layers, resolved the same way, so an operator who has learned one config ladder has
// learned all of them. Layer 2 is consulted for the human because a host runs agent tools
// from MANY checkouts (catalyst, catalyst-cloud, a customer repo) and the human answering
// for that host is a property of the host, not of whichever directory the tool was
// launched in.
//
// ## Why a display name is allowed to be absent but an id is not
//
// The id is load-bearing — a wrong or missing one silently mis-files the ask. The name is
// only prose, so `statusDocHumanHeading()` falls back to "the human", which is correct on
// every tenant and reads as deliberate rather than as a placeholder someone forgot.
//
// ## Zero-npm-import leaf
//
// node:fs / node:os / node:path only, for the same reason lib/deployment-mode.mjs states:
// `catalyst doctor` and the bare-Node agent tools import this class of module without a
// `bun install`, so it may never pull a package.

// resolveLegacyPerTeamConfigPath and linear-comment-post.sh's `_find_layer2_config` already
// do: these identities are read by agent TOOLS, which run from wherever the agent happens
// to be — a package subdirectory, a `__tests__` folder, a worktree's `plugins/dev/scripts`.
// A cwd-only check would refuse for a repo that is plainly configured, one directory down.
// The walk stops at the FIRST ancestor carrying a `.catalyst/config.json`, so a nested
// checkout never reads its parent's tenant.
