// comment-body-arg.mjs — CTL-2204. ONE rule for "what is the comment body?", shared by
// linear-reply.mjs and ask.mjs.
//
// ⛔ WHY A SHARED LEAF. The coordinator house rule "write the body to a FILE first" (it
// exists because `--body -` stdin can 401) led twice in two sessions to passing the file's
// PATH to --body. Measured 2026-08-23: 23 comments whose whole body was a
// /Users/ryan/.claude/jobs/…/tmp/*.md path, across 16 tickets, from two concierge jobs;
// 7 unrecoverable. Two tools parse --body today and the ticket asks for the identical rule
// in both — and divergent hand-written copies of one rule is this repo's recorded failure
// mode (the 2026-08-02 fleet 401 was four copies of a secret chain; CTL-1834 was five
// event-name ladders in three incompatible orders). So: one function, two importers.
//
// ⛔ A THIRD agent-facing writer is DELIBERATELY OUT OF SCOPE and still unguarded:
// `lib/linear-comment-post.sh` takes the body as a POSITIONAL ($2), not a --body flag, and
// phase-triage/SKILL.md documents it to agents as `linear-comment-post.sh <TICKET> "<body>"`.
// Its in-repo callers are programmatic phase-mirror blocks that build the body in a shell
// variable, so the residual exposure is hand-invocation. Porting this rule into that bash
// helper is a follow-up — filed as CTL-2207 — NOT part of this leaf, so read "one function,
// two importers" as a statement about the two --body PARSERS, never as "every path into a
// Linear comment".
//
// ⛔ SCOPE OF THE PATH GUARD — deliberately narrow, and the narrowness is the point.
// It fires only on an ABSOLUTE (or ~/) path to a file that PROVABLY EXISTS. It does not
// fire on a relative path (a bare `README.md` could be a legitimate one-word body), nor on
// a non-existent path (that is not evidence of the mistake — refusing it would be a guess),
// nor on any string containing whitespace or a newline (`\S+` anchored ^…$), so no real
// markdown body can trip it. Every one of the 23 measured incidents was an absolute path.
//
// ⛔ "I COULD NOT LOOK" IS NOT "NO SUCH FILE". node:fs existsSync swallows EVERY error
// (EACCES, ELOOP, ENAMETOOLONG, dangling symlink) and returns false — so a body.md inside a
// chmod-000 directory read as "not a file" and the PATH was posted verbatim, which is the
// incident this leaf exists to prevent. Every existence question therefore goes through the
// three-valued `probeFile` below (statSync + throwIfNoEntry:false): true / false / null,
// where null means the check itself could not answer. On the --body side an inconclusive
// probe REFUSES (PATH_UNCHECKABLE) — refusing a path-shaped string is recoverable, posting
// one is not. On the --body-file side it falls through to the read, which is the
// authoritative answer for "can I get these bytes".
//
// ⛔ TILDE IS EXPANDED ON BOTH SIDES, THROUGH ONE HELPER. The --body refusal's remedy names
// the path back to the operator ("use --body-file ~/x.md"), so if only --body expanded `~/`
// that suggested command would itself fail with "--body-file not found" — a refusal whose
// own advice is un-followable. Both branches call expandTilde().
//
// This leaf NEVER exits, NEVER throws, and NEVER reads fd 0 — it returns a verdict and lets
// the caller own its exit code and message. `-` comes back as {ok:true, stdin:true} for the
// caller to read.
