# linear-transition - Single source of truth for transitioning Linear ticket
# state. Reads stateMap from `.catalyst/config.json`, is idempotent, and emits
# JSON when requested. Used by the orchestrator's PR-merge safety net, by
# workers at end of `/oneshot`, and by the bulk-close helper. CTL-69.
#
# Usage:
#   linear-transition.sh --ticket <ID> --transition <name> [--state <literal>]
#                        [--config <path>] [--force] [--dry-run] [--json]
#
#   --ticket <ID>        Linear ticket identifier (required)
#   --transition <name>  State map key to look up (one of: backlog, todo,
#                        research, planning, inProgress, verifying, reviewing,
#                        inReview, done, canceled, duplicate). Required unless
#                        --state given.
#   --state <literal>    Literal state name (takes precedence over --transition)
#   --config <path>      Path to .catalyst/config.json. Default: auto-discover
#                        by walking up from CWD.
#   --force              Skip idempotency check (always call update even if
#                        ticket is already in target state)
#   --dry-run            Print what would happen without calling linearis
#   --resolve-only       CTL-1889. Resolve the target state and STOP — emit
#                        {targetState, targetStateId, currentState, action} and exit 0,
#                        writing nothing. Unlike --dry-run it does NOT require the
#                        linearis binary, because its caller is the cloud write proxy,
#                        which reaches Linear under the cloud's grant rather than this
#                        host's. That distinction is the point: the end state of
#                        CTL-1889 is a host with NO Linear credential and no reason to
#                        have linearis installed, and the state-resolution chain below
#                        (per-project stateMap > global stateMap > registry triageStatus
#                        > built-in default) must keep working there. Duplicating that
#                        chain in JS would make this script one of two sources of truth.
#   --print-state        CTL-2300. Print the resolved stage NAME for --transition and
#                        stop — no read, no write, no linearis, no ticket needed. Pass
#                        --team <KEY> instead of --ticket (or as well; --ticket's prefix
#                        is used when --team is absent). This is what shipped skill text
#                        calls instead of typing a stage name into a `--status` argument:
#                        `--status "$(linear-transition.sh --print-state --transition
#                        inProgress --team "$TEAM")"`. A stage name typed into a query is
#                        the silent half of this ticket — a board that calls the stage
#                        something else returns an EMPTY LIST, not an error — and this
#                        keeps the resolution chain (per-project stateMap > global
#                        stateMap > registry triageStatus > bootstrap) as ONE
#                        implementation rather than growing a second one for readers.
#                        ⛔ REQUIRES jq and exits 1 without it: every config rung here is
#                        jq-gated, so a jq-less host could only ever print the bootstrap,
#                        and this value is interpolated into somebody else's query where a
#                        wrong stage name returns an empty list instead of an error.
#   --json               Emit a JSON result to stdout (default: human-readable)
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  success (transitioned, idempotent skip, dry-run, or linearis missing)
#   1  usage error (missing required args)
#   2  linearis update call failed
