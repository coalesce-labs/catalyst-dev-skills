// linear-reply.mjs — CTL-1958. Post a MACHINE reply on a Linear issue via the cloud write
// proxy, credential-free:
//   • threaded UNDER the human's comment (parentId = the ROOT of that thread; Linear threads
//     are one level deep, so a reply-to-a-reply must target the root — measured, CTL-1891),
//   • authored as the app actor ("Catalyst Cloud"), never as a personal token (a
//     personal-identity comment reads as the human deciding and clears `needs-human`),
//   • the agent tag rendered in the BODY (see the identity note below).
//
// Usage:
//   node linear-reply.mjs <ISSUE-ID> --as <AGENT> (--body <markdown|-> | --body-file <path>) [--parent <commentId>|--top] [--keep-eyes]
//   (body may also come from stdin: --body -; or from a file's CONTENTS: --body-file <path>)
//   ⛔ CTL-2204: --body REFUSES a path to an existing file (exit 2, naming --body-file) — a
//   path is never a valid comment body. Use --body-file <path> to post that file's contents.
// Without --parent/--top: threads under the ROOT of the most recent comment authored by a
// HUMAN (non-bot) user on the issue; if none exists, posts top-level.
// Prints JSON {ok, via, parentId, eyesCleared} on success; non-zero exit + message on failure.
//
// ⛔ CTL-1958 — PROXY-OR-REFUSE, NO CREDENTIAL LEFT. This tool used to mint an app-actor
// token to (a) READ the issue's comments (to find the latest human comment + its reactions)
// and (b) WRITE the comment directly against the Linear GraphQL API. That mint is the
// per-host "Catalyst Orchestrator" credential CTL-1889 exists to retire, so it is GONE:
//   • the READ moves to the local Catalyst-Cloud replica (credential-free) via
//     readReplyContext / readCommentThreadRoot / readIssueId; a missing/unreadable replica
//     throws LOUDLY, never a silent "no comment",
//   • the comment WRITE goes through the CTC-724 cloud `comment` route; any non-`proxy`
//     resolution REFUSES and posts nothing (AC3),
//   • the direct comment-create and direct reaction-delete fallbacks are DELETED.
//
// ⛔ PER-AGENT IDENTITY IS DROPPED UNTIL CTC-762. The cloud `comment` route accepts only
// {issueId, body, parentId?} — it has no parameter for the per-agent author name or avatar
// the old direct mutation passed, so the comment posts as the generic cloud app actor. That
// is a real reader-UX regression, mitigated by rendering the `--as <AGENT>` tag in the body
// (below). The AC requires *app-actor* authorship (preserved), not per-agent identity.
//
// ⛔ THE EYES-CLEAR IS BEST-EFFORT, INCLUDING UNDER ENFORCE. It runs AFTER the comment has
// already been posted; refusing there would report FAILURE for a reply that succeeded, and
// ask.mjs could retry into a DOUBLE-POSTED comment. So a failed clear warns and leaves the
// exit code 0. (linear-ack is deliberately different: there the reaction IS the whole
// operation, so refusing is correct — nothing has been written to contradict.)
