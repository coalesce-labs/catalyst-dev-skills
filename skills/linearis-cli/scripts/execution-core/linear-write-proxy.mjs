// linear-write-proxy.mjs — CTL-1889 increment 1.
//
// The host-side transport that sends a Linear WRITE to the Catalyst Cloud write
// proxy under the ONE Catalyst Cloud grant, authenticated with the PER-HOST KEY,
// instead of writing to Linear directly with this host's own app-actor.
//
// ── WHAT INCREMENT 1 IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT ──
// IS:      a mode-gated transport (off | shadow | enforce, default off) covering the
//          three routes CTC-509 inc 2 already serves — issue-state, label, comment —
//          plus the per-host-key resolution and the LOUD no-credential refusal.
// IS NOT:  the retirement of anything. No credential, mint path, or LINEAR_* secret
//          is removed here. Retirement is gated on a shadow window with zero
//          host-originated writes, which cannot be run until this ships.
//
// ── ⛔ THE HOST SENDS NOTHING FOR IDENTITY ──
// ADR-0031 (CTC-486): the cloud derives WHICH host wrote from the per-host key it
// authenticated, not from anything in the request. So this transport deliberately
// sends NO host name, node name, hostname header, or actor field — adding one would
// re-create the two-identity confusion the ticket exists to remove, and would make
// the cloud's attribution depend on a value the host can lie about.
// `buildProxyRequest` is pure and `linear-write-proxy.test.mjs` asserts the absence
// positively (no header, no body key) rather than trusting this comment.
//
// ── WHY THE TRANSPORT IS SYNCHRONOUS ──
// `applyLabel` / `applyPhaseStatus` in linear-write.mjs are SYNCHRONOUS and are
// called from inside the scheduler's synchronous convergers (scheduler.mjs's own
// comment: "applyLabel is sync + never throws"). Making the transport async would
// mean making those async, i.e. an async refactor of schedulerTick — a cross-cutting
// change that has nothing to do with this ticket and would make the diff unreviewable.
// So the wire call is a `spawnSync` of `curl`, matching the module it interposes on,
// which already reaches Linear by spawning `linearis` and `linear-transition.sh`.
//
// ── ⛔ THE CREDENTIAL NEVER ENTERS argv, AND NEVER TOUCHES DISK ──
// `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <tok>"` puts the token in the process table, where
// any `ps` on the host reads it. `--config <file>` puts it on disk. Both are refused.
// Every option — method, url, headers, AND body — is written to curl's stdin as a
// `--config -` document, so argv carries only `["--config","-"]` plus non-secret
// timeouts. `linear-write-proxy.test.mjs` asserts the token appears in NO argv element,
// and round-trips the config document through a REAL curl against a local server so
// the escaping is proven by observation, not by reading the escaper.
//
// ── ROUTE PATHS AND PAYLOADS ARE MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED ──
// An earlier cut of this module shipped DEFAULT_ROUTES as a declared ASSUMPTION,
// because the CTC-509 contract lives in the cloud repo and that cut could not reach it.
// It is reachable, and the assumption was wrong on every route and every payload:
// the guessed `/linear/{issue-state,label,comment}` would have 404'd, and the guessed
// bodies (`{ticket, transitionKey}`, `{ticket, mode, labels}`) would have 400'd behind
// them. Read off `apps/mirror/src/index.ts` on catalyst-cloud `origin/main` (5e852bd):
//
//   POST /api/v1/agent/issue-state    {issueId, stateId}                    → handleAgentIssueState
//   POST /api/v1/agent/issue-label    {issueId, labelIds[], mode:add|remove} → handleAgentIssueLabel
//   POST /api/v1/agent/issue-comment  {issueId, body, parentId?}            → handleAgentIssueComment
//
// Every id is a Linear UUID — see linear-write-proxy-resolve.mjs, which is where the
// daemon's identifier/name vocabulary becomes one. `mode` is `add` or `remove` ONLY:
// there is no `overwrite`, so a single-label removal sends `remove` with that one id
// rather than an overwrite carrying the remaining set.
//
// The per-route Layer-2 override (`catalyst.linearWriteProxy.routes.<route>`) is KEPT
// even though the defaults are now measured — the cloud can move a route without a
// release of this repo, and the override is what makes that a config change.
//
// ── ⚠️ THE CREDENTIAL CLASS IS PART OF THE CONTRACT ──
// These routes require a PER-HOST, ORG-OWNED WorkOS API key. The tenant-wide
// ADMIN_TOKEN authenticates (it is a machine principal) but carries no WorkOS key id,
// so the cloud refuses it by name: "credential has no per-host binding". A host is
// therefore not made ready by lighting this flag alone; see the `no-cloud-token` /
// `unauthorized` refusals below, both of which are LOUD and NAMED rather than a silent
// fallback.
//
// FLEET STATE, measured 2026-08-18 07:15-07:20 CT — BOTH minis carry a per-host key:
//
//     mini    claim CTL-1956 -> {"won":true,"generation":1}   read-back {"current":true}
//     mini-2  claim CTL-1956 -> {"won":true,"generation":2}
//
// run from each daemon's own live process env under `mode=enforce`, against a Done
// ticket so the fence could not influence a dispatch decision. A proxied write cannot
// succeed without the per-host binding, so this supersedes the 2026-08-17 line that used
// to sit here: "mini still carries the ADMIN_TOKEN and is refused". THAT IS NO LONGER
// TRUE, and it was the sentence an operator would read to plan a rollout — it said half
// the fleet could not be armed. Corrected the day the rollout ran.
//
// ⚠️ The GET read-back is NOT a weaker check than a write, and it is easy to assume it is:
// `resolveReadOnlyAgentContext` calls the SAME `resolveAgentPrincipal` as
// `resolveWriteContext`, including `hostId = authz.keyId` and the `if (!hostId) -> 403`
// refusal. Only the BUDGET half differs. So `GET /agent/attachments` -> 200 already proves
// a per-host binding, and it is the right preflight before arming a host.

 * the human's LATEST comment means 'read, working on it'; it comes OFF once the reply is
 * posted (not at resolution)" — a read-receipt on ONE comment. `linear-ack.mjs` reacts to
 * a comment rather than the issue and never reads before it writes, and nothing in this
 * repo gates work admission on a Linear reaction. The exclusion primitive is
 * `cluster-claim.mjs`'s `catalyst://fence/<TICKET>` soft-CAS, which is the `attachment`
 * route above.
 *
 * ⛔ Recording that matters, because the next reader who discovers the 👀 is not a claim
 * would otherwise conclude the constraint rested on a mistake and move it here.
 *
 * The reason that DOES survive is an ordering race, and it is independent of what the
 * reaction means: add and remove are a matched pair on the SAME object issued by TWO
 * different tools — `linear-ack.mjs` adds, `linear-reply.mjs` removes (default-on unless
 * `--keep-eyes`) — and the normal path issues add → remove within seconds. Make the add
 * fire-and-forget while the remove blocks, and the remove runs against a comment where
 * the add has not landed, finds nothing, and the add lands after it. The result is a
 * PERMANENT stale 👀 on an already-answered comment, which nothing ever clears: the clear
