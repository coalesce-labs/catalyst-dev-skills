// linear-write-budget.mjs — CTL-1936.
//
// A host-side ledger and throttle for cloud write-proxy spend.
//
// ── WHAT HAPPENED ──
// mini-2 spent its entire daily cloud write budget — 300/300 for UTC 2026-08-18 — in
// about 13 minutes, on ONE ticket: 302 of 307 writes were `route=label` on CTL-1805,
// a ticket that is Done in Linear and carries only `orchestrator`. Every Linear write
// from that host was then refused (enforce has no direct-write fallback, by design),
// and the same burst would recur at every UTC day boundary.
//
// ⛔ CTC-674 IS NOT THE DEFECT. Before it, removing an already-absent label returned
// 400, so `clearStalledLabel`'s CTL-1078 back-off engaged and held the loop to ~6/hour.
// CTC-674 correctly made that call return 200 `already-absent` — and the back-off, which
// only counts FAILURES, stopped engaging. The loop went from ~6/hour to ~1,700/hour.
// An error response had been doing a rate limiter's job and nobody knew. The idempotency
// fix is right; what was missing is this file.
//
// ── WHY A PER-TICKET CAP AND NOT A HOST CAP ──
// The failure is a non-converging caller, whose signature is volume concentrated on ONE
// ticket — 302 vs 5 for everything else. A host-wide cap would fire on a host that is
// legitimately busy across many tickets, which AC2's own negative control forbids: "a cap
// that fires on healthy fan-out is a worse defect than the one it replaces." So the
// throttle is per-ticket, and a refusal for one ticket never blocks another's writes.
