# claude-json-mutate.sh — Single, locked owner for ~/.claude.json mutations.
# CTL-1890: two concurrent callers (trust-workspace.sh, create-worktree.sh)
# both used jq→mktemp→mv with zero synchronisation, silently losing updates.
#
# Usage: bash claude-json-mutate.sh <subcommand> [args]
# Subcommands:
#   trust-project <path>                     — trust a directory in Claude Code
#   converge-owned <topLevelKey> <specJson>  — (Phase 2) marker-aware converge
#
# Lock design: mirrors acquire_watchdog_lock / acquire_forward_lock in
# catalyst-monitor.sh — mkdir test-and-set + dead-owner stale reaper + bounded
# wait. No advisory file-lock: stock macOS ships none. Portable to bash 3.2 + restricted PATH.
#
# Environment overrides (for hermetic tests):
#   CLAUDE_JSON              target file (default: ~/.claude.json)
#   CLAUDE_JSON_LOCK_TURNS   max acquire retries (default: 100, ~10s at 0.1s/turn)
#   CLAUDE_JSON_LOCK_SLEEP   sleep between retries in seconds (default: 0.1)

      # Single-winner reap gate (CTL-1890 P1 review finding): multiple waiters
      # can observe the SAME dead owner in the same turn. Racing them straight
      # into `rm -rf` + `mkdir` on the real lock let waiter B's
      # authorized-but-stale `rm -rf` delete waiter A's freshly-live lock right
      # after A reclaimed it, so both proceeded to believe they held the lock
      # and mutated concurrently (lost updates).
      #
      # `${_CJM_LOCK_DIR}.reap` is a separate, disposable arbitration marker —
      # never the real lock directory itself — so contesting it can never
      # delete or rename a live lock out from under its true owner. (An
      # earlier version of this fix tried renaming the real lock directory via
      # `mv` to pick a single winner; that still lost the race in stress
      # testing because a bare rename can't tell "the stale dir I saw" apart
      # from "a brand-new live one another waiter just created at that path,"
      # and happily steals whichever one is currently there.) `mkdir` is
      # atomic, so exactly one waiter wins this gate; every other waiter's
      # `mkdir` fails and it falls straight through to the ordinary
      # sleep/retry below, never touching the real lock. The gate itself is
      # held only across the syscalls below, so a crash inside that window
      # (leaking `${_CJM_LOCK_DIR}.reap` forever) is the same class of
      # narrow, accepted risk as the pre-existing ownerless-lock window
      # (P2 review finding) — not addressed here.
      #
      # Winning the gate is not enough by itself: the `_cjm_lock_is_stale`
      # call above can read a genuinely-live owner and still reach a stale
      # verdict, because under real contention (many bash/jq/mkdir/cat
      # forks) a waiter can be descheduled by the OS for tens of
      # milliseconds between reading the owner pid and acting on it — long
      # enough for that owner to finish and release NORMALLY and a brand
      # new, live owner to acquire the same path in between. Stress testing
      # reproduced exactly this: a waiter's stale verdict, computed against
      # an already-superseded owner, won the gate and destroyed a different,
      # live waiter's freshly-acquired lock. So re-validate with a FRESH
      # staleness read immediately before the destructive step, once we are
      # the sole gate-holder — this shrinks the read-then-act window from
      # "however long the OS chooses to deschedule us" down to the handful
      # of syscalls between this check and the `rm -rf`.
