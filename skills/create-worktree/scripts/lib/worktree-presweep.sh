# the given worktree path. Must be called BEFORE any `git worktree remove` to
# prevent ORPHAN supervisor leaks (CTL-649 Component 5: ~70% of the observed
# 157-session leak was sessions whose cwd worktree had been yanked out from
# under them).

# Usage: worktree-presweep.sh [--force] <worktree-path>
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — no sessions remain (or --force was set and we tried)
#   1 — sessions still alive after the attempt and --force was not set
#   2 — usage error
