## Configuration Note

This command uses ticket references like `PROJ-123`. Replace `PROJ` with your Linear team's ticket prefix:

- Read from `.catalyst/config.json` if available
- Otherwise use a generic format like `TICKET-XXX`
- Examples: `ENG-123`, `FEAT-456`, `BUG-789`

You are tasked with creating a git worktree for parallel development work.

**Paths.** Commands below name files inside this skill's own directory as `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/…`. Claude Code fills that in. On any other harness, set CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR to the absolute directory that contains this SKILL.md before running them. If you cannot, stop and report `skill_dir_unresolved`.

## Process

When this command is invoked:

1. **Gather required information**:
   - Worktree name (e.g., PROJ-123, feature-name)
   - Base branch (default: current branch)
   - Optional: Path to implementation plan

2. **Confirm with user**: Present the worktree details and get confirmation before creating.

3. **Create the worktree**: Use the create-worktree.sh script:

   ```bash
   "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/create-worktree.sh" <worktree_name> [base_branch] [--no-from-remote] [--skip-fetch]
   ```

   The script automatically:
   - Reads `catalyst.worktree.setup` from config for project-specific setup
   - Copies `.claude/` and `.catalyst/` directories
   - Falls back to auto-detected setup if no config (dependency install + thoughts init)

   **Resume-from-remote (default-on, CTL-1640).** When a NEW branch is being created and `origin/<worktree_name>` already exists (e.g. a pushed draft PR's commits, CTL-783), the worktree is seeded from that remote tip instead of being cut fresh off the base branch — so a re-dispatch or a cross-host reclaim rebuilds on the pushed work rather than orphaning it under a fresh branch. This is automatic; the script prints a `🌱 Resuming from origin/<name>` banner when it fires. An existing **local** branch always wins over the remote (no auto-merge); the resume applies only when there is no local branch yet.

   To opt out and force a fresh branch off the base (ignore any matching origin branch), pass **`--no-from-remote`**. To suppress all origin fetches entirely (offline), pass **`--skip-fetch`** (which also disables the resume). Confirm with the user which they want before overriding the default when a matching origin branch may carry stale or already-merged history.

4. **Project setup** (handled by script based on config):

   If `catalyst.worktree.setup` is defined in config, those commands run in order. Otherwise, the script auto-detects: dependency install (`bun/npm`) + thoughts init.

   Example config for full control:

   ```json
   {
     "catalyst": {
       "worktree": {
         "setup": [
           "humanlayer thoughts init --directory ${DIRECTORY} --profile ${PROFILE}",
           "humanlayer thoughts sync",
           "bun install",
           "~/.claude/scripts/trust-workspace.sh \"$(pwd)\""
         ]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

5. **Optional: Launch implementation session**: If a plan file path was provided, ask if the user
   wants to launch Claude in the worktree. Note: `claude -w` takes a _name_ and creates a new worktree — so `cd` into the already-created worktree instead, capture stderr to a real file for post-mortem debugging, and use `--dangerously-skip-permissions` since there's no TTY.
   ```bash
   (
     cd "<worktree_path>" || exit 1
     exec nohup claude \
       --output-format stream-json --verbose \
       --dangerously-skip-permissions \
       -p "/catalyst-dev:implement-plan <plan_path> and when done: create commit, create PR, update Linear ticket"
   ) > "<worktree_path>/worker-stream.jsonl" 2> "<worktree_path>/worker-stderr.log" &
   ```

## Worktree Location Convention

Worktree base directory is resolved in this order:

1. `catalyst.orchestration.worktreeDir` from config (explicit override)
2. `~/catalyst/wt/<projectKey>/` (default — reads `catalyst.projectKey` from config)
3. `~/catalyst/wt/<repo>/` (fallback if no config)

**Recommended**: Add `~/catalyst` to Claude Code's `additionalDirectories` in `~/.claude/settings.json` so all worktrees across projects are automatically trusted.

**Example layout** (for project with `projectKey: "acme"`):

```
~/catalyst/wt/acme/
├── ACME-123-feature/
├── ACME-456-bugfix/
└── ENG-789-oauth/
```

**With orchestration** (multiple named orchestrators):

```
~/catalyst/wt/acme/
├── auth-orch/                       # orchestrator
├── auth-orch-ACME-101/              # worker
├── auth-orch-ACME-102/              # worker
├── dash-orch/                       # another orchestrator
└── dash-orch-ACME-201/              # worker
```
