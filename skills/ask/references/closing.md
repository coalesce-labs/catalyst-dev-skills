# Closing an ask — verify, reply, then Done

When the answer satisfies the ask: **verify** that it does (e.g. a token really carries the permission), then:

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/ask.mjs" accept CTL-NNNN --as <AGENT> --body "accepted — …"
#   --body-file <path>  post a FILE'S CONTENTS (preferred for anything multi-line)
#   --body -            read the reply from stdin
#   --dry-run           show what it would reply and close, without writing
```

`accept` replies in-thread as the app actor and moves the ticket to Done. Two refusals are deliberate: it **refuses a ticket without the `catalyst-ask` label** (closing a work ticket because an id was mistyped is not recoverable by the person who typed it), and if the reply fails it leaves the ticket **OPEN** rather than closing it — a Done ask with no recorded answer is worse than an open one, because it clears the human's view while the decision goes unrecorded.

The manual equivalent: reply threaded **"accepted — has what it needs"** (or state exactly what is still missing), and **move the ticket to the done stage yourself** (`linear-transition.sh --ticket <ID> --transition done`, which resolves the tenant's own name for that stage rather than typing ours — CTL-2300). Downstream work continues on the work tickets. If the human's action surfaces a defect (CTC-649 → CTC-652), file the defect, `blocks →` the ask, keep the ask open, say so in the thread.
