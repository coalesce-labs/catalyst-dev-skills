# Threading and identity in Linear — the canonical copy

Every Catalyst agent that writes anything a human can see follows this file. It is the single source: the `steward`, `concierge` and `phase-*` skills link here and must not restate these rules in their own words. Two copies of a rule is how they drift.

## Threads are one level deep

Linear threads have exactly one level (measured, CTL-1891). `parentId` must be the **root** of a thread, never another reply. So:

- Replying to a reply → target that thread's **root**.
- A new topic → a **new top-level comment**. Burying a new question inside an old thread still gets it
  answered, but under the old root.
- Default target when picking up a human message: the **root of the most recent human comment**.

## Who the comment is from

- Author every human-visible write as the app actor **"Catalyst Cloud"**, tagged with the role via
  `createAsUser=<role>`.
- ⛔ **Never post under the human's identity.** `linearis issues discuss` uses the personal token and
  posts *as* the human — and a human-identity comment is what the fleet reads as "the human decided", which clears the escalation hold (CTL-1567). It is not a style preference; it corrupts state.
- ⛔ **An agent never answers the human's own note as the human.** If a human comment needs a decision
  only that human can make, it comes back as an ask ticket, not as a reply written in their voice.

### Tag grammar

| role | tag |
| -- | -- |
| tier 1 — the one agent the human talks to | `concierge` |
| tier 2 — one per initiative/project | `steward/<scope-slug>` |
| tier 3 — per ticket, per phase | `worker/<phase>` |
| an instrument (pages a role, never a human) | `instrument/<name>` |

The tag is what appears in `botActor.userDisplayName`, so **the tag is the vocabulary** — it is recorded as an ADR before it ships, because history cannot be re-tagged.

## The helper (do not hand-roll the write)

```bash
direnv exec . node "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/linear-reply.mjs" CTL-NNNN --as <ROLE> --body-file <path>
#   --body-file <path>  post the FILE'S CONTENTS (preferred for anything multi-line)
#   --body "<markdown>" post a literal string
#   --body -            read the body from stdin
#   --parent <id>       thread under a specific comment (its ROOT is used)
#   --top               start a new top-level comment
```

⛔ **Write the body to a file, then pass it with `--body-file` — never with `--body`.** This guard exists because the file-first habit produced 23 published comments whose entire body was a tmp path, across 16 tickets, before CTL-2204.

⚠️ **The guard is a backstop, not the guarantee — `--body-file` is.** `--body` refuses (exit 2) only a string that is *provably* the mistake: **absolute or `~/`-rooted**, **whitespace-free**, and **naming a file that exists** (an existence probe that cannot answer — EACCES, ELOOP — also refuses, since refusing a path-shaped string is recoverable and posting one is not). That narrowness is deliberate: it is what keeps a real one-word markdown body from ever tripping the guard, and every one of the 23 measured incidents had that shape. So a **relative** path (`tmp/reply.md`), a path that does **not exist**, or one **containing a space** is accepted as the literal body and published verbatim. Do not treat "`--body` would have caught it" as a reason to reach for `--body`; reach for `--body-file`.

The helper posts through the cloud write proxy as the app actor and needs no client credentials of its own (CTL-1958); it requires `CATALYST_LINEAR_WRITE_PROXY=enforce` plus a cloud token, and refuses under any other resolution.

## Acknowledging with 👀

The human is looking at the **last message they wrote**, not the top of the thread.

- **On pickup** — the moment you start reading a human comment — react `eyes` on that human's **latest**
  comment: `node "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/linear-ack.mjs" <ISSUE>` (app actor). It means "read, working on it", not "resolved".
- **On reply** — `linear-reply.mjs` removes the eyes automatically when the reply posts (`--keep-eyes`
  to leave it).

⚠️ **Linear returns comments newest-first.** Sort explicitly before choosing "the latest human comment". Both helpers do; anything you write yourself must too — acking the oldest message has already happened. Only the human's own comments count — `ASK_HUMAN_ID`, defaulting to this tenant's `catalyst.human.linearUserId` (CTL-2299; there is no person-shaped fallback, an unconfigured tenant refuses loudly); the decision trigger's replies carry a `user` field too and will fool a naive check.

## What a reply says

Three parts, always, so a human can skim:

1. **what was done**,
2. **the outcome as applied** — not proposed, not "will do",
3. **where the artifact lives** (PR / file / route / ticket).

A reply that says "will do" is not a reply. Post it when the artifact exists, threaded under the same root.

## Claiming

Before starting work on a scope: set the assignee on the tracking ticket **and** 👀 the human's latest comment. A claim that is only in your own head is invisible to every other agent.

## Reads and writes

- **Reads → the local replica behind a freshness gate on the `-wal` mtime**, never the Linear API. The
  `.db` mtime lags under WAL mode, so gating on it reads a live replica as stale. See the `linearis` skill.
- **Writes → `linearis` / the cloud proxy.** Under the CTL-1961 gate every host write rides the proxy.

| proxy route | status |
| -- | -- |
| `issue-comment`, `issue-state`, `issue-label`, `me/ask-answer` | exists |
| `reaction`, `issue-create` | exists (CTL-1961 / CTC-724 / CTC-725) |

⚠️ **This table was wrong in the direction of under-claiming, and the correction matters (CTL-2300).** It said `reaction` and `issue-create` did not exist while `linear-ack.mjs` was already calling `reaction` through the proxy and the cloud was already serving both — so a reader following this reference reached for `linearis` and the personal token for a write the app actor could have made. The single source is `DEFAULT_ROUTES` in `scripts/execution-core/linear-write-proxy.mjs` (this skill carries a copy); read it rather than trusting a table in prose.

⚠️ **A route existing is not the same as this plugin using it.** `linear-ack.mjs` sends `reaction` through the proxy; `ask.mjs` still calls `linearis issues create` directly, so an ask filed by the skill is attributed to the host's personal token even though `issue-create` is live. Read the route table as "what the cloud will accept", and the caller as "what we actually send" — they are two facts, and only the first one is above.

Where the caller does go through the proxy, the write is attributed to the app actor. Where it does not — `linearis` writing with the host's personal token — the history reads as the human, so two things are required:

1. Say **"moved by `<role>` via linearis"** in the accompanying comment, so the history reads honestly
   (COORD-179).
2. Treat it as a known attribution defect, not as license — it is exactly why the proxy routes exist.

## Cite only what exists

File the ticket, read the identifier back out of the create call, **then** cite it. Citing a number you have not created yet is not a harmless placeholder: identifiers are dense, so a guessed one is usually a real, unrelated ticket, and the pointer looks plausible while being wrong.
