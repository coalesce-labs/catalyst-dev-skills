# Triage — ranking what's waiting on the human, and not duplicating it

Two jobs live here. **Before** you raise an ask: don't create a duplicate. **After** asks exist: rank them by what they actually hold up, so the human is told what to do first rather than handed a list.

Both depend on one thing being true: **every ask records what it blocks.** An ask with no `blocks` relation is structurally unrankable — invisible to every query below, no matter how long it has waited. Measured 2026-08-21: 2 of 5 open asks had no blocking link, one of them the oldest item on the human's plate (71h). That is the same class of defect as a body the trigger cannot parse (see [`creating.md`](creating.md)) — it looks fine on the board and cannot work.

## Before you create: search for an existing ask

One decision should be one ask. When several agents hit the same wall and each files its own, the human sees N tickets for one decision and each carries a fraction of the true urgency — so the decision that is actually blocking the most work sorts *below* trivia.

Search open asks before creating (replica only — never the Linear API, it is a shared fleet quota).

⛔ **A miss is only evidence of absence if the replica was fit to answer.** During a writer outage or a mid-reseed this query returns nothing, and "nothing" then reads as "no existing ask" — which files the duplicate this page exists to prevent. So gate the search, and treat an ungated or stale result as **inconclusive**: do not create, resolve the replica first.

```bash
# Resolve the path and the freshness gate the canonical way — CATALYST_REPLICA_DB /
# CATALYST_DIR are honored, and replica_fresh checks writer-lock recency AND a
# non-empty sync_meta cursor (seed complete, not mid-reseed).
. "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/lib/linear-read-replica.sh"
if ! replica_fresh "$CATALYST_REPLICA_DB"; then
  echo "INCONCLUSIVE — replica stale/absent; do NOT create an ask on this evidence." >&2
else
  sqlite3 "$CATALYST_REPLICA_DB" "
  SELECT i.identifier, i.state, substr(i.title,1,80)
  FROM issues i
  WHERE i.removed_at IS NULL
    AND i.state NOT IN ('Done','Canceled','Duplicate')
    AND EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM issue_labels il JOIN labels l ON l.id = il.label_id
                WHERE il.issue_id = i.id AND l.name IN ('catalyst-ask','ask/decision'));"
fi
```

⚠️ Match the two canonical label names **exactly**, against the normalized `issue_labels`/`labels` tables. The earlier form of this query read `json_extract(raw,'$.labels.nodes')` and matched `LIKE '%ask%'`; both are wrong. `raw.labels` is an **array** in the replica, so the `.nodes` path matched nothing for those rows, and `%ask%` additionally swallows unrelated labels such as `task`. Measured on the live replica 2026-08-21: the old predicate found **5** open asks where there were **11** — six invisible, five of them blocking real work.

**If an open ask already covers your decision, ATTACH — do not file a second one.** Add a `blocks` edge from that ask to your work ticket:

```bash
linearis issues update <EXISTING-ASK> --blocks <YOUR-WORK-TICKET>
```

⚠️ `linearis --relates-to` / relation flags drop all but the LAST one — **one relation per invocation**. Read it back and confirm the edge landed; a relation that silently fails to attach is the failure this whole page exists to prevent.

Attaching is strictly better than duplicating: it *raises* the existing ask's measured urgency instead of splitting it, which is what moves it up the human's list.

## Ranking: blast radius, not age

Age is the wrong sort key. "Waiting 71h" and "blocks an urgent production bug" are different facts, and only the second one tells the human what to do first.

**Blast radius** = how much open work an ask holds up, weighted by that work's priority. Linear priority is `1=Urgent 2=High 3=Medium 4=Low 0=None`; the weighting below is deliberately steep so that blocking one urgent ticket outranks blocking three chores:

| blocked ticket priority | weight |
| -- | -- |
| 1 Urgent | 8 |
| 2 High | 4 |
| 3 Medium | 2 |
| 4 Low / none | 1 |

Ready-made:

```bash
bash "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/ask-triage.sh"      # ranked, with the one-line roll-up
bash "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/human-blocked.sh"   # genuinely blocked vs missing-link vs phantom label
```

`ask-triage.sh` sorts by weighted score, then by the highest priority it blocks, then by age — and flags any ask with no blocking link, because that is a data defect to fix, not a low-priority item.

Both scripts gate on replica freshness and warn if it is stale rather than reporting yesterday's world as today's.

## Reporting it to the human

Do not hand over the list. Lead with the recommendation and the reason, in that order:

> There are 5 things waiting on you. The two that matter: **PROJ-132 first** — it's the only one
> holding up urgent work (blocks PROJ-841, P1). Then **PROJ-135**, blocking a high-priority ticket
> that's ready to move the moment you decide. Two others (PROJ-709, 71h; PROJ-875) don't record what
> they block, so I can't tell you their real cost — that's a gap, not a judgment.

Rules that make this land:
- **Name what to do first and why** — the *why* is the blocked work, not the ask's own age.
- **Say what you cannot rank, and why.** Silence about a 71-hour item reads as "nothing there."
- **Plain English, no internal mechanism names.** The human is deciding a product question, not
  reading a scheduler trace.

## Routing: who to send it to

Today: one human per tenant, so every ask goes to `catalyst.human.linearUserId` and routing is a no-op. **Deliberately deferred, not overlooked.** When more than one human can answer, this section gains: how an ask picks its addressee (scope owner? assignee of the blocked work? explicit `--to`?), what happens when the addressee doesn't answer, and whether an unrouted ask is an error or falls back to a default owner. Do not invent that scheme ad-hoc when the second human appears — extend this file.
