// linear-ack.mjs <ISSUE> [--emoji eyes] [--remove] [--comment-id <id>] — CTL-1958
// Record the 👀 "read, working on it" claim (as the app actor) on the latest HUMAN comment
// of an issue, THROUGH the cloud write proxy.
//
// ⛔ CTL-1958 — PROXY-OR-REFUSE, NO CREDENTIAL LEFT. This tool used to mint an app-actor
// token and both READ (find the latest human comment) and WRITE (the direct reaction
// mutations) against the Linear GraphQL API. That mint is the per-host "Catalyst
// Orchestrator" credential CTL-1889 exists to retire, so it is GONE:
//   • the READ moves to the local Catalyst-Cloud replica (credential-free, ~/catalyst/
//     catalyst-replica.db) via readLatestHumanComment; a missing/unreadable replica throws
//     LOUDLY (never a silent "no comment"),
//   • the reaction WRITE was already routed through the CTC-724 `reaction` route (CTL-1961),
//   • the direct add/remove reaction mutations are DELETED — there is no app-actor write
//     path on this host anymore, so anything the write-path leaf does not resolve to
//     `proxy` REFUSES and writes nothing (AC3). The reaction IS the whole operation here
//     (unlike linear-reply's best-effort eyes-clear), so refusing is the correct terminal
//     answer and nothing has been written to contradict.
//
// These tools therefore require CATALYST_LINEAR_WRITE_PROXY=enforce + a cloud token; every
// other resolution (off/shadow/unset, or enforce with no reachable proxy) refuses.
//
// Prints JSON {via:"proxy", applied, commentId, emoji, mode} on success.

// ── CTL-1961: construct the write proxy once ────────────────────────────────────────
// Constructed, NOT fetched via getLinearWriteProxy(): that accessor returns an installed
// singleton nothing installs in a standalone script, so it answers null every time and the
// routing would silently never engage. `unavailable` is kept as a REASON rather than
// collapsed into "off" — see lib/linear-write-path.mjs on why those must never be one answer.

// ⛔ CTL-2026 — THE LEAF IMPORT MUST BE INSIDE THIS GUARD. The catch below exists BECAUSE an
// out-of-tree copy cannot resolve these imports; importing the leaf on its own line above the
// try would die with an unhandled module-resolution error before the branch written for that
// case could run. (Measured 2026-08-18 by copying this file alone into an empty directory.)
//
// ⛔ AND THE MODE MUST BE READ BEFORE THE GUARD. `proxyMode` was assigned INSIDE the try, so an
// unreachable-modules host fell through with the initialiser "off" still in place — the one
// state in which the refusal matters was also the one state that computed "no proxy configured".
// The env read below is the only mode source that survives the modules being gone; it is
// deliberately weaker (env only, no Layer-2), so an absent variable reports UNCONFIRMED, not "off".
