// lib/canonical-event.mjs — the SINGLE shared builder for a canonical ("v2") event-log
// line emitted by an execution-core timer (CTL-1817).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Three envelope shapes coexist on the event log. Measured on mini over
// 2026-08 (1,119,671 events): v2 (has `attributes`) 1,094,099 · v1 (has `event`) 25,040 ·
// v3 (has a bare top-level `name`) 532. otel-forward maps a log line to an OTLP LogRecord
// assuming v2:
//
//   body:       ev.body?.message ?? ev.attributes?.["event.name"] ?? ""
//   attributes: toAttrArray(ev.attributes ?? {})
//
// A v3 line satisfies NEITHER optional chain, so it is forwarded off-machine with an empty
// body AND empty attributes — the record reaches Loki carrying nothing but a timestamp and a
// severity. The event exists on the host and is destroyed in transit. Both v3 producers
// (stale-pr-rescue-timer, orphan-pr-sweep-timer) had hand-rolled the same bare envelope:
//
//   JSON.stringify({ name, ...payload, ts })     // <- no attributes, no body, no resource
//
// so the identifier (the ticket, or the PR number) survived ONLY inside the event name, and
// the name itself was not on the wire. This module is the one place that shape now lives.
//
// A LEAF, deliberately: it imports node:crypto and lib/catalyst-resource.mjs and NOTHING
// else. No config.mjs (which drags bun:sqlite), no pino. Callers own their own append, so a
// producer that already resolves getEventLogPath() keeps doing so and this stays cheap to
// import from anywhere.
//
// Prior art / shape reference: fence-event.mjs (CTL-863), which this mirrors field for field.
// The ~12 other bespoke build*Event() emitters in execution-core each still inline this same
// envelope; folding them onto this builder is deliberate follow-up, not part of CTL-1817.

 * buildCanonicalEventLine — assemble one canonical JSONL event line (string, "\n"-terminated).

 *   1. `body.message` is ALWAYS non-empty (it defaults to the event name), and
 *   2. `attributes["event.name"]` is ALWAYS present,
 * so the record can never map to the empty OTLP LogRecord described above.
 *
 * @param {object} spec
 * @param {string} spec.name              full event name, e.g. "phase.rescue.escalated.CTL-1832" (required)
 * @param {unknown} [spec.payload]        structured detail → body.payload; omitted entirely when undefined/null
 * @param {string} [spec.serviceName]     resource service.name (default "catalyst.execution-core")
 * @param {object} [spec.attributes]      extra OTel attributes merged AFTER event.name (identifiers belong here)
 * @param {string} [spec.severityText]    default "INFO"
 * @param {number} [spec.severityNumber]  default 9 (INFO)
 * @param {object} [seams]                injectable clock/id seams so tests get a deterministic envelope
 * @returns {string} the JSONL line, newline-terminated
 * @throws {Error} when `name` is missing or not a non-empty string — fail CLOSED. A nameless
 *   event is exactly the degenerate record this module exists to prevent, so it must not be
 *   constructible; the caller's try/catch turns it into a logged best-effort miss.

// ─── CTL-1795: the v1→superset dual envelope ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A SECOND shape is still live on the log alongside v3's now-fixed producers: **v1**, the flat
// `{ts, event, ...snake_case fields}` envelope. Measured on mini over 2026-08 (2,544,842 events):
// v2 2,384,622 · **v1 159,009 across 31 distinct names** · v3 1,006. Every one of those 159k is
// invisible to a consumer that reads `attributes["event.name"]`, with no error — which is how the
// design audit that produced this project missed 27 names on its own first pass.
//
// THE WIRE SHAPE IS ONE SUPERSET LINE, NOT TWO LINES. The line carries BOTH the top-level v1
// `event` and a full v2 `attributes`/`body`/`resource` block. Two separate lines would be a
// correctness bug, not merely wasteful: a v1 line and its v2 twin BOTH resolve to the same name
// and BOTH get routed. For `agent.checkin`/`agent.checkout` that means `handleAgentCheckin`/
// `handleAgentCheckout` run `upsertAgent` and `_autoRegisterPrLifecycle` twice per real event.
// (CTL-1834: the safety is in it being ONE line, not in the key order — one line resolves to one
// name under any ordering. The name is now resolved in exactly one place, lib/event-name.mjs.)
//
// The superset line is safe against every shape discriminator that reads this log, each verified
// against the tree rather than assumed:
//   · otel-forward `isFlatEvent` (lib/normalize.ts:20) requires `!("attributes" in o)`, so a
//     superset line is NOT claimed by it and forwards as already-canonical — no re-normalization,
//     and the producer's attributes reach OTLP intact.
//   · `canonical_jsonl_append`'s legacy rotation (lib/canonical-event.sh) and orch-monitor's
//     `event-writer.ts:136` both key on `has("attributes")`, so a superset line does NOT rotate
//     the live month file aside.
//   · `catalyst-state.sh:193` passes an attributes-bearing line straight through, untranslated.
//
// PHASE 1 IS ADDITIVE. v1 emission is NOT removed here and `catalyst-events tail`/`wait-for` are
// NOT narrowed to v2 — that is an explicit follow-up one release later, once consumers are
// confirmed reading v2. Re-emitting the plain v1 line is the revert.

/**
 * FLAT_ATTRIBUTE_MAP — which v1 flat fields are promoted to first-class OTel attributes.
 *
 * Deliberately byte-identical to otel-forward's `ATTR_MAP` (lib/normalize.ts:8-15), because
 * that is what the forwarder produces for these events TODAY. Once a producer emits the
 * superset shape the forwarder stops normalizing it (`isFlatEvent` no longer matches), so any
 * divergence here would silently change the attribute set of 159k events/month arriving in
 * Loki — a dashboard break landing at the same moment as a shape change, which is exactly the
 * kind of coupled failure this ticket exists to prevent. Keep the two in lockstep; the
 * dual-envelope test asserts the table contents literally.
