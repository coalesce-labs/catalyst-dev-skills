# Done-judgment — verify the ticket is genuinely done, not just this PR

Relocated from the retired `phase-teardown` daemon phase-agent (CTL-2223; the original was CTL-1157), with the worker-dir/signal-file/`open-pr-gate.mjs` daemon plumbing stripped down to the judgment rubric itself. Run this **unconditionally** before every Linear Done transition — do not skip it because the ticket "probably" has only one PR: the whole point is to catch the human PR, second slice, or abandoned spike you don't already know about, and a check gated on already knowing there's a second PR never fires when it's needed most.

**Do not trust "this PR merged" as proof the ticket is done.** A ticket can have more than one PR: a second slice, a human PR opened outside the automated flow, an abandoned spike from an earlier attempt. The PR you just merged is only the one you were tracking — marking Done while another open PR is still part of the solution is silent rot.

## Step 1 — Enumerate the ticket's other open PRs

Union three passes, since any one alone can miss a PR:

1. **Title/body search** — a PR that names the ticket key anywhere in its title or description:
   `gh pr list --search "${TICKET} in:title,body" --state open --json number,title,url,headRepository`
2. **Branch-head search** — a PR that uses the ticket's branch name but never mentions the ticket key in its title/body (this pass alone catches what the search above misses):
   `gh pr list --head "${BRANCH_NAME}" --state open --json number,title,url,headRepository`
3. **Linear attachment search** — a PR attached to the ticket that matches neither of the above. List the ticket's attachments with `linearis attachments list <TICKET> --source-type github` (not `issues show` — the replica's ordinary issue record omits attachments).

**If any pass cannot be completed** (search failed, `gh`/`linearis` auth or rate-limit error, an attached PR you can't view) — that is **unverifiable, not clean**. Do not treat a failed check as "no open PR remains." Retry, check by hand, or hold the Done transition and say why.

## Step 2 — Reason about every open PR found, and resolve it yourself

- **Still needed / part of the solution** → finish it (rebase, fix CI, merge) before marking Done. Don't tear down with deliverable work still unmerged.
- **Abandoned / superseded** (a later PR replaced it, a dead spike, a duplicate) → close it yourself: `gh pr close <n> -R <owner/repo> --comment "<why — superseded by #X / abandoned / duplicate of #Y>"`. Closing a dead PR is autonomous, not an escalation.
- **Cross-repo PR** — when a PR is in a different repo than the one you're working in, target that repo explicitly on **every** `gh pr` call: `gh pr merge <n> -R <owner/repo> …` / `gh pr close <n> -R <owner/repo> …`. A bare `gh pr close <n>` runs against your current repo and can close or merge the wrong same-numbered PR there while leaving the actual `owner/repo#n` open.
- **Genuine judgment call** (the open PR conflicts with an ADR/principle, or you can't safely decide needed-vs-abandoned) → do not mark Done. Report the concrete reason so a human can decide — this is the rare case; every mechanically-resolvable PR you finish or close yourself.

## Step 3 — Only then, transition to Done

Once no open PR remains that *should* remain, proceed with the ticket's Done transition and any cleanup. A ticket torn down with an open PR still attached is exactly the failure this rubric exists to prevent — if you skip it, there is nothing left to catch the silent rot.
