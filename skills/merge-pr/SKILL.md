# Merge Pull Request

Safely merges a PR after comprehensive verification, with Linear integration and automated cleanup.

**Paths.** Commands below name files inside this skill's own directory as `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/…`. Claude Code fills that in. On any other harness, set CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR to the absolute directory that contains this SKILL.md before running them. If you cannot, stop and report `skill_dir_unresolved`.

## Prerequisites

```bash
# Thoughts must exist for this skill's documents. CTL-2306: the full host setup check (daemon,
# registry, house rules) belongs to the setup-catalyst skill, not to a skill that must run anywhere.
[[ -e thoughts/shared ]] || echo "⚠️ thoughts/shared is missing in $(pwd) — run \`humanlayer thoughts init\` or the setup-catalyst skill; if the prompt names an output path, write there" >&2
```

## Safety rules

**NEVER** use `--admin`, `--force`, or any flag that bypasses branch protection. Always resolve
blockers legitimately or escalate with specifics. See
`"${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/assets/references/merge-blocker-diagnosis.md"` for the full safety rules section.

## Process overview

1. **Identify PR** — use argument or `gh pr view`/`gh pr list` if none given.
2. **Verify open + mergeable** — rebase if behind, resolve conflicts or exit.
3. **Run local tests** — skip with `--skip-tests`.
4. **Diagnose blockers + reactive wait** — check whether the unified event log is live first (`~/catalyst/events/YYYY-MM.jsonl` present and the daemon running): if so, [blocker-loop.md](references/blocker-loop.md)'s single disjunctive `wait-for` (CI, reviews, push, merge/close) with authoritative `gh api` REST re-check on every wake-up; if the substrate is absent — the relay default since the daemon's retirement — poll instead, on [bounded-poll.md](references/bounded-poll.md)'s merge/review cadence (interval/ceiling), performing the SAME resolution actions as blocker-loop.md's table (CI fix-up, bot-thread resolve via `/review-comments`, BEHIND update) each tick, and checking readiness each tick with [gh-signal-traps.md](references/gh-signal-traps.md)'s combined CI-ready + review-ready check — not `bounded-poll.md`'s bare `bounded_poll_pr_state` alone, which only detects `MERGED`/`CLOSED` and has no way to ever cause either, so a CI-green, fully-reviewed-but-not-yet-merged PR would poll uselessly to the ceiling on that check alone. Proceed to Step 5 once CLEAN.
5. **Squash merge + cleanup** — checkout-free remote-ref delete (CTL-56), Linear ticket to Done,
   worktree-safe local branch delete. **catalyst-cloud queue-merge default (CTC-1219):** for an
   eligible catalyst-cloud PR (no `hold:hand-steps`, no schema/migration path), this step applies
   `queue:ready` and stops instead of calling `gh pr merge` — Mergify (`.mergify.yml`) owns the
   actual merge, and "merged by mergify[bot]" is the terminal signal the coordinator/steward
   watches for, not this session. Hand-step PRs and every other repo keep hand-merging unchanged.
   Re-entrant: re-running this skill against an already-mergify-merged PR skips straight past the
   merge call into cleanup, so Linear/deploy/compound still fire. See
   [worktree-safe-merge.md](references/worktree-safe-merge.md) Step 9 for the exact conditions. **Phase-container guard:** skip every `linearis` call when `CATALYST_PHASE` is set (a phase container holds no Linear credential; the runner owns the ticket write-back) or when `command -v linearis` fails (the CLI is not installed); say so in one line and continue.
6. **Post-merge** — deployment detection + verification, then (once that verification is terminal) compound-estimate, ticket-compound, ticket-retro, and the success summary.
