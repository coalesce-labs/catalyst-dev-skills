# Implementation Plan

You are tasked with creating detailed implementation plans through an interactive, iterative process. You should be skeptical, thorough, and work collaboratively with the user to produce high-quality technical specifications.

Replace `PROJ` in ticket references with your Linear team's prefix from `.catalyst/config.json`.

**Paths.** Commands below name files inside this skill's own directory as `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/…`. Claude Code fills that in. On any other harness, set CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR to the absolute directory that contains this SKILL.md before running them. If you cannot, stop and report `skill_dir_unresolved`.

## Prerequisites

```bash
# Thoughts must exist for this skill's documents. CTL-2306: the full host setup check (daemon,
# registry, house rules) belongs to the setup-catalyst skill, not to a skill that must run anywhere.
[[ -e thoughts/shared ]] || echo "⚠️ thoughts/shared is missing in $(pwd) — run \`humanlayer thoughts init\` or the setup-catalyst skill; if the prompt names an output path, write there" >&2

# CTL-2306 explicit-input discovery: begin
# Find the research to plan from on disk for the ticket this run was given: $CATALYST_TICKET under a
# phase, else a ticket named in the skill's argument text (Claude Code substitutes the token in
# the heredoc below; another harness leaves it literal, which names no ticket). Nothing is
# remembered between runs. `[!0-9]` keeps PROJ-1 from matching PROJ-10's documents.
TICKET_ID="${TICKET_ID:-${CATALYST_TICKET:-}}"
if [[ -z "$TICKET_ID" ]]; then
  SKILL_ARGS=$(cat <<'CATALYST_SKILL_ARGS'
$ARGUMENTS
CATALYST_SKILL_ARGS
)
  TICKET_ID=$(printf '%s' "$SKILL_ARGS" | grep -oE '[A-Z]+-[0-9]+' | head -1)
  [[ -n "$TICKET_ID" ]] || TICKET_ID=$(printf '%s' "$SKILL_ARGS" | tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]' | grep -oE '[A-Z]+-[0-9]+' | head -1)
fi
RECENT_RESEARCH=""
if [[ -n "$TICKET_ID" ]]; then
  RECENT_RESEARCH=$(find -H thoughts/shared/research -type f -name '*.md' -ipath "*${TICKET_ID}[!0-9]*" -exec ls -t {} + 2>/dev/null | head -1)
elif [[ -z "${CATALYST_PHASE:-}" ]]; then
  RECENT_RESEARCH=$(find -H thoughts/shared/research -type f -name '*.md' -exec ls -t {} + 2>/dev/null | head -1)
fi
# CTL-2306 explicit-input discovery: end
if [[ -n "$RECENT_RESEARCH" ]]; then
  echo "📋 Found research: $RECENT_RESEARCH"
else
  echo "⚠️ No research found on disk for ${TICKET_ID:-this run} — ask for it (or read the paths the prompt names)"
fi
```

## Session Tracking

```bash
# Session tracking uses the installed catalyst-session CLI when this host has one; skipped otherwise.
SESSION_SCRIPT="$(command -v catalyst-session 2>/dev/null || true)"
if [[ -n "$SESSION_SCRIPT" ]]; then
  CATALYST_SESSION_ID=$("$SESSION_SCRIPT" start --skill "create-plan" \
    --ticket "${TICKET_ID:-}" \
    --workflow "${CATALYST_SESSION_ID:-}")
  export CATALYST_SESSION_ID
  "$SESSION_SCRIPT" phase "$CATALYST_SESSION_ID" "planning" --phase 1
fi
```

## Initial Response

Auto-discovery has already run in Prerequisites above. Check its output and follow this priority:

1. **If user provided parameters** (file path or ticket reference):
   - Use the provided path (user override)
   - Read any provided files FULLY
   - If Prerequisites also discovered research (📋), mention it and ask if it should inform the plan
   - Begin the research process

2. **If no parameters provided AND Prerequisites discovered research (📋)**:
   - Show the discovered research path
   - Ask if it should be used as context for the plan
   - Wait for user's confirmation

3. **If no parameters AND no research found (⚠️)**:
   - Ask for: task/ticket description, context/constraints, related research
   - Wait for user's input

## Process Steps

### Step 1: Context Gathering & Initial Analysis

1. **Read all mentioned files immediately and FULLY**:
   - Ticket files, research documents, related plans, JSON/data files
   - **IMPORTANT**: Use the Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset parameters
   - **CRITICAL**: Read these files yourself before spawning sub-tasks

2. **Extract ticket and update Linear state**:

   If a ticket is detected (from the research document's `source_ticket` frontmatter, from the command argument, or from context), update ticket status to `stateMap.planning` from config using Linearis CLI (run `linearis issues usage` for syntax). If Linearis CLI is not available, skip silently and continue planning. **Phase-container guard:** skip every `linearis` call when `CATALYST_PHASE` is set (a phase container holds no Linear credential; the runner owns the ticket write-back) or when `command -v linearis` fails (the CLI is not installed); say so in one line and continue.

3. **Gather context using research sub-agents** — use the same agent palette and orientation process as `/catalyst-dev:research-codebase` (that skill is the single source of truth for how codebase research works). For planning, focus agents on the specific ticket/task scope rather than broad exploration:
   - **codebase-locator** — find all files related to the ticket/task
   - **codebase-analyzer** — understand how the current implementation works
   - **thoughts-locator** — find existing thoughts documents about this feature (if relevant)

4. **Read all files identified by research tasks** FULLY into the main context

5. **Analyze and verify understanding**:
   - Cross-reference ticket requirements with actual code
   - Identify discrepancies, assumptions, and true scope

6. **Present informed understanding and focused questions**:
   - Show what you found with file:line references
   - Only ask questions you genuinely cannot answer through code investigation

### Step 2: Research & Discovery

After getting initial clarifications:

1. **If the user corrects any misunderstanding**:
   - Spawn new research tasks to verify — don't just accept corrections
   - Only proceed once you've verified the facts yourself

2. **Create a research todo list** using TodoWrite

3. **Spawn parallel sub-tasks for comprehensive research**:

   **For local codebase:**
   - **codebase-locator** — find specific files
   - **codebase-analyzer** — understand implementation details
   - **codebase-pattern-finder** — find similar features to model after

   **For external research:**
   - **external-research** — framework patterns and best practices from popular repos

   **For historical context:**
   - **thoughts-locator** / **thoughts-analyzer** — find past research, plans, decisions

   Each agent's instructions ship with this skill as `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/assets/agents/<name>.md` (for example `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/assets/agents/codebase-locator.md`). With the catalyst-dev Claude Code plugin, spawn them as `catalyst-dev:<name>`. On any other harness, spawn a general-purpose subagent with that file's instructions plus your request, or do the task inline if the harness has no subagents.

4. **Wait for ALL sub-tasks to complete** before proceeding

5. **Present findings and design options** with pros/cons for each approach

### Step 3: Plan Structure Development

Once aligned on approach:

1. **Create initial plan outline** showing phases and what each accomplishes
2. **Get feedback on structure** before writing details

### Step 4: Detailed Plan Writing

After structure approval:

1. **Gather metadata**:

   ```bash
   CURRENT_ISO_DATETIME=$(date -Iseconds)
   CURRENT_DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
   GIT_COMMIT_SHORT=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)
   GIT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
   REPO_NAME=$(basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)")
   ```

   **IMPORTANT: Document Storage Rules**
   - ALWAYS write to `thoughts/shared/plans/`
   - NEVER write to `thoughts/searchable/` (read-only search index)

2. **Write the plan** to `thoughts/shared/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-PROJ-XXXX-description.md`
   - With ticket: `2025-01-08-PROJ-123-parent-child-tracking.md`
   - Without ticket: `2025-01-08-improve-error-handling.md`

3. **Use this template structure** (frontmatter comes BEFORE the heading):

````markdown

# [Feature/Task Name] Implementation Plan

## Overview

[Brief description of what we're implementing and why]

## Current State Analysis

[What exists now, what's missing, key constraints discovered]

## Desired End State

[Specification of the desired end state and how to verify it]

### Key Discoveries:

- [Important finding with file:line reference]
- [Pattern to follow]
- [Constraint to work within]

## What We're NOT Doing

[Explicitly list out-of-scope items to prevent scope creep]

## Implementation Approach

[High-level strategy and reasoning]

## Phase 1: [Descriptive Name]

### Overview

[What this phase accomplishes]

### Tests First (Red):

Define the expected behavior before writing implementation code.

#### 1. [Test File/Group]

**File**: `tests/path/to/feature.test.ext` **Tests to write**:

```[language]
// Test describing expected behavior — should FAIL before implementation
```

### Implementation (Green):

Write the minimum code to make the tests pass.

#### 1. [Component/File Group]

**File**: `path/to/file.ext` **Changes**: [Summary of changes]

```[language]
// Specific code to add/modify
```

### Refactor (if needed):

[Any cleanup, extraction, or simplification to do while tests stay green]

### Success Criteria:

#### Automated Verification:

- [ ] Unit tests pass: `make test`
- [ ] Type checking passes: `make check`
- [ ] Linting passes: `make lint`

#### Manual Verification:

- [ ] Feature works as expected when tested
- [ ] No regressions in related features

---

## Phase 2: [Descriptive Name]

[Similar structure — always Tests First → Implementation → Refactor]

---

## Testing Strategy (TDD)

**Approach: Test-Driven Development (Red → Green → Refactor)**

Each phase writes tests BEFORE implementation code. This ensures:

- Requirements are encoded as executable specifications
- Implementation stays focused on passing defined behavior
- Refactoring is safe because tests catch regressions

**Test tiers:**

- **Unit tests** — written first for each function with business logic
- **Integration tests** — written first for API endpoints and data flows
- **Edge case tests** — written first for error states, invalid inputs, auth failures

**Per-phase rhythm:**

1. Write failing tests that describe the phase's expected behavior
2. Implement the minimum code to make tests pass
3. Refactor while keeping tests green

[Additional manual testing steps if needed]

## Performance Considerations

[Any performance implications]

## Migration Notes

[If applicable]

## References

- Related research: [[YYYY-MM-DD-relevant-research]]
- Similar implementation: `[file:line]`

### Step 5: Sync, Track, and Review

**5a. Sync thoughts:**

```bash
humanlayer thoughts sync
```

**5b. Present plan** and ask for review:

- Show plan location
- Ask: Are phases properly scoped? Success criteria specific enough? Missing edge cases?
- If context >60%, recommend clearing before implementation phase

4. **Iterate based on feedback** until the user is satisfied
   - Re-sync thoughts after changes

5. **End session tracking:**

   ```bash
   if [[ -n "${CATALYST_SESSION_ID:-}" && -x "$SESSION_SCRIPT" ]]; then
     "$SESSION_SCRIPT" end "$CATALYST_SESSION_ID" --status done
   fi
   ```

6. **After plan approval**, provide implementation command:

   - **Use `--team` when:** 3+ parallel phases, distinct domains, non-overlapping files, 10+ files
   - **Use standard mode when:** sequential phases, same directory, <10 files, tightly coupled

   ```
   ## Ready to Implement

   Start a new session and run:
   /catalyst-dev:implement-plan [--team] thoughts/shared/plans/{PLAN_FILENAME}

   Tip: Start a fresh session — implementation needs context for source files and progress tracking.
   ```

## Important Guidelines

1. **Be Skeptical**: Question vague requirements. Don't assume — verify with code.
2. **Be Interactive**: Don't write the full plan in one shot. Get buy-in at each step.
3. **Be Thorough**: Read all context files COMPLETELY. Include file:line references. Use `make check` over individual lint/test commands when available.
4. **Be Practical**: Focus on incremental, testable changes. Include "what we're NOT doing".
5. **No Open Questions in Final Plan**: Research or ask for clarification immediately. The plan must be complete and actionable — every decision made before finalizing.

## Success Criteria Guidelines

**Always separate into two categories:**

1. **Automated Verification** (run by agents): `make test`, `make lint`, type checking, etc.
2. **Manual Verification** (requires human): UI/UX, performance, edge cases, acceptance criteria

## Common Patterns

All patterns follow TDD: write tests for each step BEFORE implementing it.

### For Database Changes:

Schema/migration → **tests for** store methods → store methods → **tests for** business logic → business logic → **tests for** API → API → clients

### For New Features:

Research patterns → data model → **tests for** backend logic → backend logic → **tests for** API endpoints → API endpoints → **tests for** UI components → UI

### For Refactoring:

**Capture existing behavior as tests first** → incremental changes (keep tests green) → backwards compatibility → migration strategy

## Linear Integration

State names (`stateMap.*`) come from the `linearis` skill's single-source transition table — not restated here.

If a ticket is detected (from research document's `source_ticket` frontmatter, command argument, or context):

- **At planning start** (Step 1): Update ticket status to `stateMap.planning` from config using Linearis CLI (run `linearis issues usage` for syntax).
- **After plan saved**: Add a comment with the plan path — this is an agent-authored comment, so post it through the app actor (`linear-reply.mjs --as <role>`, or the `linear-comment-post.sh` helper), never bare `linearis issues discuss`/`reply` (those post as the human — see the `linearis` skill's "Comment on a ticket" section).
- If the tooling is not available, skip silently and continue planning
