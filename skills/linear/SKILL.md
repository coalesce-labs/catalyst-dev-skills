# Linear - Ticket Management

Create tickets from thoughts documents, update existing tickets, and follow the Linearis-CLI workflow.

**Paths.** Commands below name files inside this skill's own directory as `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/…`. Claude Code fills that in. On any other harness, set CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR to the absolute directory that contains this SKILL.md before running them. If you cannot, stop and report `skill_dir_unresolved`.

## Setup check (first, every session)

`node "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/identity-report.mjs"` — one line per identity (tenant, human, team, cloud host), and every `unresolved` line is a stop-and-say (CTL-2300). A write addressed to the wrong team or the wrong workspace does not error; it lands somewhere plausible, which is why this runs before the first read as well as the first write.

## REQUIRED: ticket format gate

**Before creating ANY ticket, apply the `/catalyst-dev:gherkin-ticket` standard** — an outcome-first title (`<actor> should <outcome> [so that <benefit>]`, no `[Component]` prefix) and a body leading with a plain-English use case, then tiered Gherkin acceptance criteria. Hard gate: do not draft a title/description without it. Component goes in a label, not the title.

## Reading Linear, and cloud detection

A **single ticket** read goes through the `linearis` skill's "Reading Linear" rule and its `linear_read_ticket` helper (source `"${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/lib/linear-read-replica.sh"`, which this skill carries) — do NOT hand-roll a second version. A **scope-wide list/search** (across a project, team, or query) is NOT something that helper does — it covers one ticket at a time — so that stays on the `linearis` CLI directly, same as the `linearis` skill's Core Operations.

Either way, run the **same cloud-detection check** before trusting the replica for anything: confirm `replica_fresh` **and** the `.catalyst/config.json` marker (`plugin_dirs_repo_config_path`, from `"${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/lib/plugin-dirs.sh"`). Either failing is a loud, non-silent fallback to direct `linearis`/API reads — the non-fleet path, never an equal alternative; it protects the shared 2500/hr Linear API quota. Writes always go through `linearis`.

## Configuration

Team key/UUID and thoughts-URL come from `.catalyst/config.json`; prerequisites check, the JSON shape, and URL-mapping rules: [`references/setup-and-examples.md`](references/setup-and-examples.md).

## Workflow status

State names come from the `linearis` skill's **single-source** `stateMap` transition table — this skill does not restate it. Commands auto-update status on that table: `/research-codebase` → `stateMap.research`, `/create-plan` → `.planning`, `/implement-plan` → `.inProgress`, `/create-pr` → `.inReview`, `/merge-pr` → `.done`. Skip silently if Linearis is unavailable.

## Action-specific instructions

| action | steps |
| --- | --- |
| Create a ticket from a thoughts doc | [`references/creating-tickets.md`](references/creating-tickets.md) |
| Comment, move through workflow, or search | [`references/moving-and-searching.md`](references/moving-and-searching.md) |
| Full worked example (thought → ticket → plan → implement → PR → merge) | [`references/setup-and-examples.md`](references/setup-and-examples.md) |

## Notes

- **Labels overwrite by default**: `linearis issues update --labels` **replaces** every label on the ticket unless you pass `--label-mode add`. Cross-team same-name label trap: the `linearis` skill's label reference (CTL-1802).
- **CLI required**: Linearis CLI installed and configured with `LINEAR_API_TOKEN`. **Phase-container guard:** skip every `linearis` call when `CATALYST_PHASE` is set (a phase container holds no Linear credential; the runner owns the ticket write-back) or when `command -v linearis` fails (the CLI is not installed); say so in one line and continue.

For Linearis CLI syntax and the Linear read/cloud-detection rule, see the `linearis` skill (`/catalyst-dev:linearis`) — this skill does not restate either.
