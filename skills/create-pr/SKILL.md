# Create Pull Request

Orchestrates the complete PR creation flow: commit → rebase → push → create → describe → link Linear ticket.

**Paths.** Commands below name files inside this skill's own directory as `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/…`. Claude Code fills that in. On any other harness, set CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR to the absolute directory that contains this SKILL.md before running them. If you cannot, stop and report `skill_dir_unresolved`.

## Prerequisites

```bash
# Thoughts must exist for this skill's documents. CTL-2306: the full host setup check (daemon,
# registry, house rules) belongs to the setup-catalyst skill, not to a skill that must run anywhere.
[[ -e thoughts/shared ]] || echo "⚠️ thoughts/shared is missing in $(pwd) — run \`humanlayer thoughts init\` or the setup-catalyst skill; if the prompt names an output path, write there" >&2
```

## No Claude attribution

The PR is authored solely by the git user. Never add "Generated with Claude Code", "Co-Authored-By: Claude", or any AI-assistance reference to its title or body.

## Process overview

1. **Preflight** — uncommitted changes, not on main/master, detect base branch, rebase if behind, check for an existing PR, extract the ticket from the branch name. See [preflight.md](references/preflight.md).
2. **Title, push, create, link Linear** — title prefers the first commit subject via `git log --no-merges` and `draft_pr_title` (the `<type>(<scope>): <ticket>` convention, CTL-783); the no-commit fallback runs `tr '-' ' '` on the branch slug. Push goes through `draft_pr_push_verify` (`git fetch`-verified, `--force-with-lease` retry, CTL-1051). The PR body gets the CTL-623/633 sibling-skip guard via `linear-pr-skip.sh`'s `linear_sibling_skip_block_from_branch` — siblings are referenced by **PR number**, never a bare token; full rationale: the describe-pr skill's `linear-sibling-guard` reference. Then auto-call `/describe-pr` and update Linear (skip the transition under `CATALYST_PHASE`). See [push-and-create.md](references/push-and-create.md).
3. **Monitor to a clean merge state** — CI, automated reviewers, blocker resolution; this is NOT optional. See [monitoring-loop.md](references/monitoring-loop.md).
4. **Report the real outcome, not just "PR created."** See [outcomes-and-errors.md](references/outcomes-and-errors.md), which also covers error handling, examples, and integration with `/commit`/`/describe-pr`/`/merge-pr`.

## Configuration

Uses `.catalyst/config.json` (`linear.teamKey`, `linear.stateMap.inReview`). State names have sensible defaults — the `linearis` skill's single-source `stateMap` transition table is the canonical list; not restated here.

## Load on demand

| Situation | Reference |
|---|---|
| Uncommitted changes, branch/base checks, existing-PR prompt, ticket extraction | [preflight.md](references/preflight.md) |
| Title generation, guarded push, PR creation + sibling-skip guard, Linear link | [push-and-create.md](references/push-and-create.md) |
| Event-driven CI/reviewer wait, blocker diagnosis loop, re-poll criteria | [monitoring-loop.md](references/monitoring-loop.md) |
| Final-state reports, error handling, worked examples, command integration | [outcomes-and-errors.md](references/outcomes-and-errors.md) |

## Remember

- **Never stop at "PR created"** — monitor through to a clean or genuinely human-blocked state.
- For Linearis CLI syntax, see the `linearis` skill reference. **Phase-container guard:** skip every `linearis` call when `CATALYST_PHASE` is set (a phase container holds no Linear credential; the runner owns the ticket write-back) or when `command -v linearis` fails (the CLI is not installed); say so in one line and continue.
