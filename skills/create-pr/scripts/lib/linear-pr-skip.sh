# linear-pr-skip — emit Linear "skip <ID>" guard lines for every foreign ticket
# token found in branch or body text, so Linear's GitHub integration does NOT
# auto-link sibling tickets and drag their workflow status.
# CTL-623 introduced the helper; CTL-633 split it into two scope-bounded modes
# to stop body-mode prose ("Released 2026-05-25", "fixes UTF-8 handling",
# "OAUTH-2 cleanup", "abc123 commit") from fabricating fake foreign tokens.
#
# Two-mode design:
#   linear_foreign_tokens_from_branch <branch> [<branch> …]
#     Keeps the original awk segmenter: walks the slug char-by-char and
#     recovers same-prefix sibling numbers under the most-recent team prefix
#     (the orchestrator-built `o-adv-1155-1156-1157-ADV-1155` shape produced
#     by setup-orchestrator.sh::build_orch_name). This is the ONLY legitimate
#     bare-number-recovery source in the repo. Output piped through the
#     team-key allowlist filter for defense in depth.
#
#   linear_foreign_tokens_from_body <body> [<body> …]
#     Canonical-only extraction via `grep -oE '\b[A-Z]+-[0-9]+\b'`. NO prefix
#     recovery, NO mixed-alpha emission. Prose, dates (2026-05-25), SHAs
#     (075e1ff5), lowercase pseudo-tokens (oauth2/utf8/abc123/api-v2), and
#     dashed-date prose cannot fabricate. Canonical body tokens (`see ENG-50`)
#     are still captured and ALSO filtered through the team-key allowlist —
#     the allowlist is fail-open on missing/empty cache so fresh installs
#     behave like today.
#
# Wrappers emit the HTML-comment guard + `skip <TOKEN>` block per mode:
#   linear_sibling_skip_block_from_branch <own> <branch>
#   linear_sibling_skip_block_from_body   <own> <body>
#
# Back-compat: linear_sibling_skip_block / linear_foreign_tokens default to
# branch mode (the original primary use case — orchestrator slug recovery).
#
# Direct exec stays branch-mode (`linear-pr-skip.sh <own> <branch>` works).
#
# Team-key allowlist: see linear-team-keys.sh (sibling lib in this dir).

# Source the team-key allowlist helper. Fail-open if the file is missing
# (defensive — both helpers ship together via CTL-633).
#
# Dir resolution must work under BOTH bash and zsh. The Catalyst Bash tool runs
# zsh, where ${BASH_SOURCE[0]} is unset — so a BASH_SOURCE-only resolver
# collapsed to the CWD and silently failed to source the sibling lib (CTL-633
# phase-review finding #1). The producers (create-pr/describe-pr)
# all source us via "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/lib/linear-pr-skip.sh", so
# CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT is the reliable anchor in the real runtime; fall back to
# BASH_SOURCE for `bash linear-pr-skip.sh` direct exec and bash sourcers.
#
# CTL-2306: skills now carry this helper inside their own directory and source it by
# ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}, so the plugin root is no longer the anchor. Locate this file
# itself first — zsh's sourced-file expansion, then BASH_SOURCE — and fall back to
# CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT only when neither resolves.
