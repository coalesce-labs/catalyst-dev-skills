# Verify, Save, and Write Back (Steps 10–13)

## Step 10 — Run verification checks

For each checklist item in "How to Verify It" (e.g. `- [ ] Build passes: \`make build\``), try to run the extracted command and mark the box: `✅` if it passed, `❌` with the error if it failed, or "(manual verification required)" if it can't be automated. Common checks: `make test`/`npm test`/`pytest`, `make lint`/`npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`/`tsc --noEmit`, `make build`/`npm run build`.

## Step 11 — Save and sync

Always write to `thoughts/shared/prs/` — never to `thoughts/searchable/` (read-only index).

```bash
cat > "thoughts/shared/prs/${pr_number}_description.md" <<EOF
<!-- Auto-generated: $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ) -->
<!-- Last updated: $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ) -->
<!-- PR: #$pr_number -->
<!-- Previous commits: $commit_list -->

[Full description content]
EOF
humanlayer thoughts sync
```

## Step 12 — Update the PR on GitHub

**CRITICAL: NO CLAUDE ATTRIBUTION.** Before writing, strip any "Generated with Claude Code", "Co-Authored-By: Claude", or other AI-assistance references. Write in first person attributed to the human author ("I added...", "We implemented...").

```bash
gh pr edit $pr_number --title "$new_title"

body_file="thoughts/shared/prs/${pr_number}_description.md"

# shellcheck source=/dev/null
source "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/lib/linear-pr-skip.sh"
body="$(cat "$body_file")"
skip_block="$( {
    linear_sibling_skip_block_from_branch "$ticket" "$branch"
    linear_sibling_skip_block_from_body   "$ticket" "$body"
} | awk '/^skip /{if(!seen[$0]++) print; next} {if(!h){print; h=1}}' )"
[[ -n "$skip_block" ]] && printf '\n%s\n' "$skip_block" >>"$body_file"

gh pr edit $pr_number --body-file "thoughts/shared/prs/${pr_number}_description.md"
```

This is a **call site**, not the guard's rationale — see [linear-sibling-guard.md](linear-sibling-guard.md) for why both modes run here and what the dedup does.

## Step 13 — Update the Linear ticket

If a ticket was found and Linearis is available: update status to `stateMap.inReview` (see `linearis issues usage`), then add a comment with the PR link and verification summary — posted through the app actor (`linear-reply.mjs` / `linear-comment-post.sh`), never a bare `linearis issues discuss`. Skip silently if the CLI isn't available.

**Skip the status transition when `CATALYST_PHASE` is set** — under a phase agent or a `relay-ticket` session, the coordinator driving that ticket already owns the Linear status write-back; this transition is for interactive `/catalyst-dev:describe-pr` use only. The PR-link comment is still posted in both modes.
