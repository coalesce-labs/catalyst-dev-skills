# Shape tests for the handoff write-then-cite contract (CTL-2104).
#
# The runtime behavior lives in plugins/dev/scripts/lib/handoff-durability.sh
# and is covered by lib/__tests__/handoff-durability.test.sh. THIS suite guards
# the other half: that the prose skills actually WIRE that helper, and that the
# recovery rule the stewards used to survive the incident is published rather
# than staying practitioner lore. A helper nothing calls fixes nothing.
#
# Run: bash tests/handoff-contract.test.sh
# Discovered locally via run-tests.sh SKILLS_SHELL_TEST_DIR and pinned in CI by
# .github/workflows/skills-gate.yml — BOTH are required, neither is sufficient.
# Bash-3.2 safe.

#    ticket with a within-run filesystem search. A registration call left behind

# 2. The next-tick promise is true only for the async verdict. A rebase conflict

#    every local-only verdict is the same shape of over-claim as the old
#    unconditional "synced".

#    repo-relative identity too.
