# skill-shape.test.sh — CTL-1993: the progressive-disclosure shape gate.
#
# WHY: before this, every catalyst-dev skill was a single monolithic SKILL.md —
# 52 of them, up to 2,610 lines. The role skills (steward, concierge) and the
# slimmed phase skills carry their detail in `references/*.md` read on demand
# instead. That shape only survives if something enforces it: a budget nobody
# checks is a budget that drifts back (the same way the agent house-rules block
# drifted in BOTH repos while a tested, idempotent seeder sat unused).
#
# Applies to every skill dir that HAS a references/ dir — so it gates the skills
# that opted into progressive disclosure, and stays silent about the ones that
# have not been converted yet.
#
# Run: bash tests/skill-shape.test.sh

# ⚠️ THESE TWO NUMBERS ARE A PROXY, AND THE PROXY IS GAMEABLE. The property we
# actually want is "SKILL.md alone is sufficient for the common path, and detail
# is one hop away" — and NO line count can assert that. A skill can satisfy both
# budgets with longer lines and denser prose and be strictly worse to read.
#
# They are kept because a forcing function that is checkable beats an intent that
# is not: 80 lines is roughly the point at which an author stops appending and
# starts asking what belongs in references/. That editorial pressure is the
# product; the number is only how it is applied.
#
# So if you are here to raise one of these: raising it is not automatically
# wrong, but it IS the wrong first move. Defend the intent, not the number —
# move the detail into references/ first, and change the budget only if the
# common path genuinely does not fit. (FLEET peer read, CTL-1993.)

# 3. RESERVED SKILL NAMES (CTL-1997). A skill name that collides with live
#    machinery vocabulary reads as "the <machinery> skill" and mis-routes both
#    agents and greps. This is a LIST, not a single hardcoded name, because the
#    first version of this check tested exactly one name and therefore offered
#    the next collision no protection at all — someone would have re-litigated
#    it from scratch without this reasoning (FLEET peer read, CTL-1993).
#
#    TO ADD AN ENTRY: one line, and a comment saying WHAT it collides with. The
#    reason is the load-bearing half — it is what lets a future reader tell a
#    real collision from a name someone merely disliked.
#
#    ⚠️ Only reserve a name NOTHING is currently called: `linear` is a live
#    machinery word that is ALSO an existing skill, so reserving it would go
#    red on arrival and the fix would be to delete the entry, not to rename
#    50 call sites. (`broker` and `teardown` were in that boat until CTL-2240
#    removed the skills of those names with the daemon — they are reserved now.)
