#!/usr/bin/env bash
# workflow-inputs.test.sh — CTL-2306 Phase 1: skills find their input explicitly.
#
# WHY: the five skills that auto-discover a prior document (create-plan,
# iterate-plan, validate-plan, implement-plan, resume-handoff) used to read
# `.catalyst/.workflow-context.json`, a file written by a Claude-only hook and
# carried between runs. Ryan's rule (2026-09-13): a skill must never depend on
# state persisted between runs — a phase container is disposable and a
# Codex/OpenCode session never ran the hook. The replacement is explicit input:
# the ticket from the argument or the relay contract ($CATALYST_TICKET), and the
# newest document for THAT ticket found on disk within the run.
#
# Two halves:
#   1. Shape: no skill names workflow-context any more.
#   2. Behaviour: each skill's discovery block (between the CTL-2306 markers) is
#      EXTRACTED and RUN against a scratch thoughts tree, under bash and zsh
#      (the agent's Bash tool runs zsh on macOS).
#
# Run: bash tests/workflow-inputs.test.sh
# Bash-3.2 safe.
