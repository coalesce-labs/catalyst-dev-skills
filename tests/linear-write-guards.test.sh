#!/usr/bin/env bash
# linear-write-guards.test.sh — CTL-2306 Phase 1: research-codebase's Linear
# writes are guarded IN THE STEP, not only in a trailing section.
#
# WHY: a phase container holds no Linear credential and its prompt forbids
# linearis. research-codebase's two in-flow write steps (the research-state
# transition in Step 2 and the "Linear comment" in step 8b) carried no guard;
# only the `## Linear Integration` section at the bottom said "skip silently".
# A model following the numbered steps reaches the unguarded instruction first,
# so today the prompt override is the only thing standing between those steps
# and a failed or wrongly-attributed write. implement-plan already carries the
# guard in-step; this pins research-codebase to the same shape.
#
# Run: bash tests/linear-write-guards.test.sh
# Bash-3.2 safe.
