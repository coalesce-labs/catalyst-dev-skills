// ask.mjs — CTL-1922 increment 2. The `ask create` / `ask accept` verbs.
//
// ── WHY A VERB AND NOT A DOCUMENTED SNIPPET ──
// The `ask` skill already documents the exact body shape the cloud's decision trigger
// parses. Documenting it was not enough: CTC-653 measured that every ask a HUMAN filed on
// 2026-08-17 (CTC-648/649/650/651, CTL-1919, CTL-1923..1927) wrote the options inline
// instead of as a bulleted `**Options:**` block. Those parsed to ZERO options, so no reply
// could ever match and the ask was **structurally undecidable** — while looking, on the
// board and in the "what needs me" view, exactly like a well-formed one.
//
// ⛔ SO THE VERB'S JOB IS NOT TO RENDER THE BODY. It is to render it and then PROVE the
// trigger will see it: `create` reads the created ticket BACK out of Linear and parses the
// stored body with the same rules the trigger uses. A body that renders correctly and
// stores mangled is the failure this exists to catch, and only a round-trip can see it.
//
// ── ⚠️ THE PARITY RISK, STATED ──
// The authoritative parser is `apps/mirror/src/do/ask-decision.ts` in the catalyst-cloud
// repo — a DIFFERENT repo, so the one-registry/two-engines/parity-suite discipline used
// for lib/secret-contract.mjs cannot be applied mechanically here. `parseAskOptions` below
// is a hand port of that function, and it can drift. Two mitigations, neither perfect:
//   1. the port is byte-for-byte on the regexes, and each carries the reason it is written
//      that way (they are load-bearing — see OPTIONS_HEADER's alternation note);
//   2. the tests use the forms that FAILED in production, not invented ones.
// If the cloud parser changes, this validator can pass a body the trigger rejects. That is
// a real gap; it is named here rather than left for someone to discover on a dead ask.
// Ported from catalyst-cloud `apps/mirror/src/do/ask-decision.ts` (read 2026-08-17).
