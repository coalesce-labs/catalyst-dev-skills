// replica-comment-read.mjs — CTL-1958. Credential-free "latest human comment" +
// issue-id reads from the local Catalyst-Cloud replica (~/catalyst/catalyst-replica.db),
// replacing the app-actor GraphQL read that linear-reply.mjs / linear-ack.mjs used to
// mint a client_credentials token for. Moving this read to the replica is what lets
// the per-host "Catalyst Orchestrator" Linear app be uninstalled (CTL-1889).
//
// ⛔ CONTRACT DIVERGES FROM replica-read.mjs ON PURPOSE. replica-read.mjs is a hot
// accelerator and is FAIL-OPEN (any trouble → undefined → the caller falls through to a
// live read). This leaf is the ONLY read path the tools have left — the mint is being
// DELETED — so an absent/unreadable replica must be a LOUD, NAMED throw, never a silent
// "no comment" (AGENTS.md: a check that cannot fail loudly is not evidence). A well-formed
// replica that simply has no matching human comment stays a clean `null`.
//
// ⛔ CROSS-RUNTIME. The owner comms tools run under `node` (node:sqlite → DatabaseSync,
// { readOnly }); the tests run under `bun test` (bun:sqlite → Database, { readonly }).
// node:sqlite is absent under bun and bun:sqlite is absent under node, so the backend is
// selected at open time. The prepared-statement surface (.prepare(sql).get()/.all()) is
// identical across both, so only the constructor + option key differ.
//
// zero-npm-import: node:sqlite / bun:sqlite are runtime built-ins; getReplicaDbPath comes
// from the sibling config.mjs (which the tools already import), isReplicaFresh from the
// SQLite-free replica-freshness.mjs leaf, and resolveAskHuman from ../lib/tenant-identity.mjs
// (node:fs/os/path only — see CTL-2299 below).

//
// This used to be `export const DEFAULT_ASK_HUMAN_ID = "<one Linear user's uuid>"` — the
// fleet owner. On any other tenant that id authored nothing, so the query below returned
// no row and both tools read it as "the human has not commented": threading and the 👀
// clear silently dropped, with no error anywhere. A default that names a person is the
// single-tenant assumption in its most expensive form.
//
// The leaf stays pure in the sense that mattered: callers may still pass `humanId`
// explicitly, and nothing here reads process.env. What changed is the DEFAULT — it now
// resolves the tenant's configured human, and REFUSES when none is configured, matching
// this module's existing loud contract (an unanswerable read is never a clean `null`).
